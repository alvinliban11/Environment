        <p>
            For anyone contemplating the Earth’s fate, there’s probably no more
            instructive case study than the Florida Everglades. When European
            explorers first arrived there in the mid-1800s, they discovered a
            lush, tropical wilderness with dense sawgrass, marshes, mangrove
            forests, lakes, and tree islands. By the early 20<sup>th </sup>
            century, developers and politicians had begun building a series of
            canals and dikes to siphon off the region’s water. They succeeded
            in creating an agricultural and real estate boom, and to some
            degree, they offset floods and droughts. But the ecological cost
            was exorbitant. Today, half of the Everglades’ wetlands have been
            lost, its water is polluted by runoff from farms, and much of its
            wildlife, including Florida panthers and many wading birds such as
            wood storks, are hanging on by a thread.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet there has been a renewed sense of hope in the Everglades since
            2001, when the state of Florida and the federal government approved
            a comprehensive $7.8 billion restoration plan, the biggest recovery
            of its kind in history. During the next four decades, ecologists
            and engineers will work to undo years of ecological damage by
            redirecting water back into the Everglades’ dried-up marshes. “The
            Everglades are a test,” says Joe Podger, an environmentalist.“If we
            pass, we get to keep the planet.”
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, as this comprehensive series on environmental issues
            shows, humankind faces a host of tests that will determine whether
            we get to keep the planet. The world’s crises—air and water
            pollution, the extinction of species, and climate change— are
            worsening by the day. The solutions—and there are many practical
            ones—all demand an extreme sense of urgency. E. O. Wilson, the
            noted Harvard zoologist, contends that “the world environment is
            changing so fast that there is a window of opportunity that will
            close in as little time as the next two or three decades.” While
            Wilson’s main concern is the rapid loss of biodiversity, he could
            have just as easily been discussing climate change or wetlands
            destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Earth is suffering the most massive extinction of species since
            the die-off of dinosaurs 65 million years ago. “If

        <p>
            we continue at the current rate of deforestation and destruction of
            major ecosystems like rain forests and coral reefs, where most of
            the biodiversity is concentrated,” Wilson says,“we will surely lose
            more than half of all the species of plants and animals on Earth by
            the end of the 21<sup>st </sup>century.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Many conservationists still mourn the loss of the passenger pigeon,
            which, as recently as the late 1800s, flew in miles-long flocks so
            dense they blocked the sun, turning noontime into nighttime. By
            1914, target shooters and market hunters had reduced the species to
            a single individual, Martha, who lived at the Cincinnati Zoo until,
            as Peter Matthiessen wrote in <em>Wildlife in America, </em>“she
            blinked for the last time.” Despite U.S. laws in place to avert
            other species from going the way of the passenger pigeon, the
            latest news is still alarming. In its 2004 State of the Birds
            report, Audubon noted that 70% of grassland bird species and 36% of
            shrubland bird species are suffering significant declines. Like the
            proverbial canary in the coalmine, birds serve as indicators,
            sounding the alarm about impending threats to environmental and
            human health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides being an unmitigated moral tragedy, the disappearance of
            species has profound practical implications. Ninety percent of the
            world’s food production now comes from about a dozen species of
            plants and eight species of livestock. Geneticists rely on wild
            populations to replenish varieties of domestic corn, wheat, and
            other crops, and to boost yields and resistance to disease. “Nature
            is a natural pharmacopoeia, and new drugs and medicines are being
            discovered in the wild all the time,” wrote Niles Eldredge of the
            American Museum of Natural History, a noted author on the subject
            of extinction. “Aspirin comes from the bark of willow trees.
            Penicillin comes from a mold, a type of fungus.” Furthermore,
            having a wide array of plants and animals improves a region’s
            capacity to cleanse water, enrich soil, maintain stable climates,
            and produce the oxygen we breathe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink
            does not augur well for our future health and well-being. Many
            people assume that the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970

            ushered in a new age.But the American Lung Association reports that
            159 million Americans—55% of the population—are exposed to
            “unhealthy levels of air pollution.” Meanwhile, the American Heart
            Association warns of a direct link between exposure to air
            pollution and heart disease and strokes.While it’s true that U.S.
            waters are cleaner than they were three decades ago, data from the
            Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that almost half of
            U.S. coastal waters fail to meet water-quality standards because
            they cannot support fishing or swimming. Each year, contaminated
            tap water makes as many as 7 million Americans sick. The chief
            cause is “non-point pollution,” runoff that includes fertilizers
            and pesticides from farms and backyards as well as oil and chemical
            spills. On a global level, more than a billion people lack access
            to clean water; according to the United Nations, five times that
            number die each year from malaria and other illnesses associated
            with unsafe water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of all the Earth’s critical environmental problems, one trumps the
            rest: climate change. Carol Browner, the EPA’s chief from 1993
            through 2001 (the longest term in the agency’s history), calls
            climate change “the greatest environmental health problem the world
            has ever seen.” Industry and people are spewing carbon dioxide from
            smokestacks and the tailpipes of their cars into the
            atmosphere,where a buildup of gases,acting like the glass in a
            greenhouse, traps the sun’s heat. The 1990s was the warmest decade
            in more than a century, and 1998 saw the highest global
            temperatures ever.In an article about global climate change in the
            December 2003 issue of <em>Audubon</em>, David Malakoff wrote,
            “Among the possible consequences: rising sea levels that cause
            coastal communities to sink beneath the waves like a modern
            Atlantis, crop failures of biblical proportions, and once-rare
            killer storms that start to appear with alarming regularity.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet for all the doom and gloom, scientists and environmentalists
            hold out hope. When Russia recently ratified the Kyoto Protocol, it
            meant that virtually all of the world’s industrialized nations—the
            United States, which has refused to sign, is a notable
            exception—have committed to cutting greenhouse gases. As Kyoto and
            other international agreements go into effect, a market is
            developing for cap-and-trade systems for carbon dioxide. In this
            country, two dozen big corporations, including British Petroleum,
            are cutting emissions. At least 28 American states have adopted
            their own policies. California, for example,has passed global
            warming legislation aimed at curbing emissions from new cars.
            Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has also backed regulations
            requiring automakers to slash the amount of greenhouse gases they
            cause by up to 30% by 2016, setting a precedent for other states.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Washington pushes a business-friendly agenda, states are filling
            in the policy vacuum in other areas, as well. California and New
            York are developing laws to preserve wetlands, which filter
            pollutants, prevent floods, and provide habitat for endangered
            wildlife.
        </p>
        <p>
            By taking matters into their own hands, states and foreign
            countries will ultimately force Washington’s. What industry
            especially abhors is a crazy quilt of varying rules.After all,it
            makes little sense for a company to invest a billion dollars in a
            power plant only to find out later that it has to spend even more
            to comply with another state’s stricter emissions standards. Ford
            chairman and chief executive William Ford has lashed out at the
            states’“patchwork” approach because he and “other manufacturers
            will have a hard time responding.”Further, he wrote in a letter to
            his company’s top managers, “the prospect of 50 different
            requirements in 50 different states would be nothing short of
            chaos.” The type of fears Ford expresses are precisely the reason
            federal laws protecting clean air and water came into being.

            Governments must take the lead, but ecologically conscious
            consumers wield enormous influence, too. Over the past four
            decades, the annual use of pesticides has more than doubled, from
            215 million pounds to 511 million pounds. Each year, these poisons
            cause $10 billion worth of damage to the environment and kill 72
            million birds. The good news is that the demand for organic
            products is revolutionizing agriculture, in part by creating a
            market for natural alternatives for pest control. Some industry
            experts predict that by 2007 the organic industry will almost
            quadruple, to more than $30 billion.

            E. O. Wilson touts “shade-grown” coffee as one of many “personal
            habitats that, if moderated only in this country, could contribute
            significantly to saving endangered species.” In the mountains of
            Mexico and Central America, coffee grown beneath a dense forest
            canopy rather than in cleared fields helps provide refuge for
            dozens of wintering North American migratory bird species, from
            western tanagers to Baltimore orioles.

            With conservation such a huge part of Americans’ daily routine,
            recycling has become as ingrained a civic duty as obeying traffic
            lights.Californians,for their part,have cut their energy
            consumption by 10% each year since the state’s 2001 energy crisis.
            “Poll after poll shows that about two-thirds of the American
            public—Democrat and Republican, urban and rural—consider
            environmental progress crucial,” writes Carl Pope, director of the
            Sierra Club, in his recent book, <em>Strategic Ignorance. </em>
            “Clean air, clean water, wilderness preservation— these are such
            bedrock values that many polling respondents find it hard to
            believe that any politician would oppose them.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Terrorism and the economy clearly dwarfed all other issues in the
            2004 presidential election. Even so, voters approved 120 out of 161
            state and local conservation funding measures nationwide, worth a
            total of $3.25 billion. Anti-environment votes in the U.S. Congress
            and proposals floated by the like-minded Bush administration should
            not obscure the salient fact that so far there have been no changes
            to the major environmental laws. The potential for political
            fallout is too great.
        </p>
        <p>
            The United States’ legacy of preserving its natural heritage is the
            envy of the world. Our national park system alone draws more than
            300 million visitors each year. Less well known is the 103-year-old
            national wildlife refuge system you’ll learn about in this series.
            Its unique mission is to safeguard the nation’s wild animals and
            plants on 540 refuges, protecting 700 species of birds and an equal
            number of other vertebrates; 282 of these species are either
            threatened or endangered. One of the many species particularly
            dependent on the invaluable habitat refuges afford is the bald
            eagle. Such safe havens, combined with the banning of the
            insecticide DDT and enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, have
            led to the bald eagle’s remarkable recovery, from a low of 500
            breeding pairs in 1963 to 7,600 today. In fact, this bird, the
            national symbol of the United States, is about be removed from the
            endangered species list and downgraded to a less threatened status
            under the CITES, the Convention on International Trade in
            Endangered Species.
        </p>
        <p>
            This vital treaty, upheld by the United States and 165 other
            participating nations (and detailed in this series),underscores the
            worldwide will to safeguard much of the Earth’s magnificent
            wildlife. Since going into effect in 1975, CITES has helped enact
            plans to save tigers, chimpanzees, and African elephants. These
            species and many others continue to face dire threats from
            everything from poaching to deforestation. At the same time,
            political progress is still being made.Organizations like the World
            Wildlife Fund work tirelessly to save these species from extinction
            because so many millions of people care. China, for example, the
            most populous nation on Earth, is so concerned about its giant
            pandas that it has implemented an ambitious captive breeding
            program. That program’s success, along with government measures
            prohibiting logging throughout the panda’s range, may actually
            enable the remaining population of 1,600 pandas to hold its own—and
            perhaps grow. “For the People’s Republic of China, pressure
            intensified as its internationally popular icon edged closer to
extinction,” wrote Gerry Ellis in a recent issue of            <em>National Wildlife. </em>“The giant panda was not only a poster
            child for endangered species, it was a symbol of our willingness to
            ensure nature’s place on Earth.”

            Whether people take a spiritual path to conservation or a pragmatic
            one, they ultimately arrive at the same destination. The sight of a
            bald eagle soaring across the horizon reassures us about nature’s
            resilience, even as the clean air and water we both need to survive
            becomes less of a certainty. “The conservation of our natural
            resources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem
            which underlies almost every other problem of our national
            life,”President Theodore Roosevelt told Congress at the dawn of the
            conservation movement a century ago. His words ring truer today
            than ever.

            Introduction: “Why Should We Care?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Our nation’s air and water are cleaner today than they were 30
            years ago. After a century of filling and destroying over half of
            our wetlands, we now protect many of them. But the Earth is getting
            warmer, habitats are being lost to development and logging, and
            humans are using more water than ever before. Increased use of
            water can leave rivers, lakes, and wetlands without enough water to
            support the native plant and animal life. Such changes are causing
            plants and animals to go extinct at an increased rate. It is no
            longer a question of losing just the dodo birds or the passenger
            pigeons, argues David Quammen, author of <em>Song of the Dodo</em>:
“Within a few decades, if present trends continue, we’ll be losing            <em>a lot </em>of everything.”<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 1980s, E. O. Wilson, a Harvard biologist and Pulitzer
            Prize–winning author, helped bring the term <em>biodiversity </em>
            into public discussions about conservation. <em>Biodiversity</em>,
            short for “biological diversity,” refers to the levels of
            organization for living things. Living organisms are divided and
            categorized into ecosystems (such as rain forests or oceans), by
            species (such as mountain gorillas), and by genetics (the genes
            responsible for inherited traits).
        </p>

            Wilson has predicted that if we continue to destroy habitats and
            pollute the Earth at the current rate, in 50 years, we could lose
30 to 50% of the planet’s species to extinction. In his 1992 book,<em>The Diversity of Life</em>, Wilson asks: “Why should we care?”            <sup>2 </sup>His long list of answers to this question includes:
            the potential loss of vast amounts of scientific information that
            would enable the development of new crops, products, and medicines
            and the potential loss of the vast economic and environmental
            benefits of healthy ecosystems. He argues that since we have only a
            vague idea (even with our advanced scientific methods) of how
            ecosystems really work, it would be “reckless” to suppose that
            destroying species indefinitely will not threaten us all in ways we
            may not even understand.

            out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in
            the Universe.”<sup>3 </sup>For example, air pollution in one state
            or in one country can affect not only air quality in another place,
            but also land and water quality.Soil particles from degraded
            African lands can blow across the ocean and cause damage to far-off
            coral reefs.

            The six books in this series address a variety of environmental
            issues: conservation, wildlife protection, water pollution, air
            quality, climate change, and environmental policy. None of these
            can be viewed as a separate issue. Air quality impacts climate
            change,wildlife,and water quality.Conservation initiatives directly
            affect water and air quality, climate change, and wildlife
            protection. Endangered species are touched by each of these issues.
            And finally, environmental policy issues serve as important tools
            in addressing all the other environmental problems that face us.

            You can use the burning of coal as an example to look at how a
            single activity directly “hitches” to a variety of environmental
            issues. Humans have been burning coal as a fuel for hundreds of
            years. The mining of coal can leave the land stripped of
            vegetation, which erodes the soil. Soil erosion contributes to
            particulates in the air and water quality problems. Mining coal can
            also leave piles of acidic tailings that degrade habitats and
            pollute water. Burning any fossil fuel—coal, gas, or oil—releases
            large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide
            is considered a major “greenhouse gas” that contributes to global
            warming—the gradual increase in the Earth’s temperature over time.
            In addition, coal burning adds sulfur dioxide to the air, which
            contributes to the formation of acid rain—precipitation that is
            abnormally acidic. This acid rain can kill forests and leave lakes
            too acidic to support life. Technology continues to present ways to
            minimize the pollution that results from extracting and burning
            fossil fuels. Clean air and climate change policies guide states
            and industries toward implementing various strategies and
            technologies for a cleaner coal industry.

            Each of the six books in this series—ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES—
            introduces the significant points that relate to the specific topic
            and explains its relationship to other environmental concerns.

            <strong>Book One: <em>Air Quality</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Problems of air pollution can be traced back to the time when
            humans first started to burn coal. <em>Air Quality </em>looks at
            today’s challenges in fighting to keep our air clean and safe. The
            book includes discussions of air pollution sources—car and truck
            emissions, diesel engines, and many industries. It also discusses
            their effects on our health and the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reported that more
            than 150 million Americans live in areas that have unhealthy levels
            of some type of air pollution.<sup>4 </sup>Today, more than 20
            million Americans, over 6 million of whom are children, suffer from
asthma believed to be triggered by pollutants in the air.            <sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1970, Congress passed the Clean Air Act, putting in place an
            ambitious set of regulations to address air pollution concerns. The
            EPA has identified and set standards for six common air pollutants:
            ground-level ozone, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, sulfur
            dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead.
        </p>
        <p>
            The EPA has also been developing the Clean Air Rules of 2004,
            national standards aimed at improving the country’s air quality by
            specifically addressing the many sources of contaminants. However,
            many conservation organizations and even some states have concerns
            over what appears to be an attempt to weaken different sections of
            the 1990 version of the Clean Air Act. The government’s
            environmental protection efforts take on increasing importance
            because air pollution degrades land and water, contributes to
            global warming, and affects the health of plants and animals,
            including humans.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>Book Two: <em>Climate Change</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Part of science is observing patterns, and scientists have observed
            a global rise in temperature. <em>Climate Change </em>discusses the
            sources and effects of global warming. Scientists attribute this
            accelerated change to human activities such as the burning of
            fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases (GHG).<sup>6 </sup>Since
            the 1700s, we have been cutting down the trees that help remove
            carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and have increased the amount
            of coal, gas, and oil we burn, all of which add carbon dioxide to
            the atmosphere. Science tells us that these human activities have
            caused greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane
            (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O),
            hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur
hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)—to accumulate in the atmosphere.            <sup>7</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            If the warming patterns continue, scientists warn of more negative
            environmental changes. The effects of climate change, or global
            warming, can be seen all over the world. Thousands of scientists
            are predicting rising sea levels, disturbances in patterns of
            rainfall and regional weather, and changes in ranges and
            reproductive cycles of plants and animals. Climate change is
already having some effects on certain plant and animal species.            <sup>8</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Many countries and some American states are already working
            together and with industries to reduce the emissions of greenhouse
            gases. Climate change is an issue that clearly fits noted scientist
            Rene Dubois’s advice:“Think globally, act locally.”
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>Book Three: <em>Conservation</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Conservation </em>
            considers the issues that affect our world’s vast array of living
            creatures and the land, water, and air they need to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the first people in the United States to put the political
            spotlight on conservation ideas was President Theodore Roosevelt.
            In the early 1900s, he formulated policies and created programs
            that addressed his belief that: “The nation behaves well if it
            treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to
the next generation increased, and not impaired, in value.”<sup>9 </sup>In the 1960s, biologist Rachel Carson’s book,            <em>Silent Spring</em>, brought conservation issues into the public
            eye. People began to see that polluted land, water, and air
            affected their health. The 1970s brought the creation of the United
            States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and passage of many
            federal and state rules and regulations to protect the quality of
            our environment and our health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some 80 years after Theodore Roosevelt established the first
            National Wildlife Refuge in 1903, Harvard biologist
        </p>
        <p>
            E. O. Wilson brought public awareness of conservation issues to a
            new level. He warned:
        </p>
        <p>
            . . . the worst thing that will probably happen—in fact is already
            well underway—is not energy depletion, economic collapse,
            conventional war, or even the expansion of totalitarian
            governments.As terrible as these catastrophes would be for us, they
            can be repaired within a few generations. The one process now
            ongoing that will take million of years to correct is the loss of
            genetic species diversity by the destruction of natural habitats.
This is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive us.            <sup>10</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            To heed Wilson’s warning means we must strive to protect
            species-rich habitats, or “hotspots,” such as tropical rain forests
            and coral reefs. It means dealing with conservation concerns like
            soil erosion and pollution of fresh water and of the oceans. It
            means protecting sea and land habitats from the overexploitation of
            resources. And it means getting people involved on all levels—from
            national and international government agencies, to private
            conservation organizations, to the individual person who recycles
            or volunteers to listen for the sounds of frogs in the spring.

            <strong>Book Four: <em>Environmental Policy</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            One approach to solving environmental problems is to develop
            regulations and standards of safety. Just as there are rules for
            living in a community or for driving on a road, there are
            environmental regulations and policies that work toward protecting
            our health and our lands. <em>Environmental Policy </em>discusses
            the regulations and programs that have been crafted to address
            environmental issues at all levels—global, national, state, and
            local.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, as our resources become increasingly limited, we witness
            heated debates about how to use our public lands and how to protect
            the quality of our air and water. Should we allow drilling in the
            Arctic National Wildlife Refuge? Should we protect more marine
            areas? Should we more closely regulate the emissions of vehicles,
            ships, and industries? These policy issues, and many more, continue
            to make news on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, environmental policy has taken a place on the
            international front. Hundreds of countries are working together in
            a variety of ways to address such issues as global warming, air
            pollution, water pollution and supply, land preservation, and the
            protection of endangered species. One question the United States
            continues to debate is whether to sign the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the
            international agreement designed to decrease the emissions of
            greenhouse gases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the policy tools for protecting our environment are already
            in place. It remains a question how they will be used— and whether
            they will be put into action in time to save our natural resources
            and ourselves.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>Book Five: <em>Water Pollution</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pollution can affect water everywhere. Pollution in lakes and
            rivers is easily seen. But water that is out of our plain view can
            also be polluted with substances such as toxic chemicals,
fertilizers, pesticides, oils, and gasoline.            <em>Water Pollution </em>considers issues of concern to our surface
            waters, our groundwater, and our oceans.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early 1970s, about three-quarters of the water in the United
            States was considered unsafe for swimming and fishing. When Lake
            Erie was declared “dead” from pollution and a river feeding it
            actually caught on fire, people decided that the national
            government had to take a stronger role in protecting our resources.
            In 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act, a law whose objective
            “is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological
            integrity of the Nation’s waters.”<sup>11 </sup>Today, over 30
            years later, many lakes and rivers have been restored to health.
            Still, an estimated 40% of our waters are still unsafe to swim in
            or fish.
        </p>
        <p>
            Less than 1% of the available water on the planet is fresh water.
            As the world’s population grows, our demand for drinking and
            irrigation water increases. Therefore, the quantity of available
            water has become a major global issue. As Sandra Postel, a leading
            authority on international freshwater issues, says, “Water scarcity
is now the single biggest threat to global food production.”            <sup>12 </sup>Because there are many competing demands for water,
            including the needs of habitats, water pollution continues to
            become an even more serious problem each year.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>Book Six: <em>Wildlife Protection</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For many years, the word <em>wildlife </em>meant only the animals
            that people hunted for food or for sport. It was not until 1986
            that the Oxford English Dictionary defined <em>wildlife </em>as
“the native fauna and flora of a particular region.” <sup>13 </sup>            <em>Wildlife Protection </em>looks at overexploitation—for example,
            overfishing or collecting plants and animals for illegal trade—and
            habitat loss. Habitat loss can be the result of development,
            logging, pollution, water diverted for human use, air pollution,
            and climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also discussed are various approaches to wildlife protection. Since
            protection of wildlife is an issue of global concern, it is
            addressed here on international as well as on national and local
            levels. Topics include voluntary international organizations such
            as the International Whaling Commission and the CITES agreements on
            trade in endangered species. In the United States, the Endangered
            Species Act provides legal protection for more than 1,200 different
            plant and animal species. Another approach to wildlife protection
            includes developing partnerships among conservation organizations,
            governments, and local people to foster economic incentives to
            protect wildlife.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>CONSERVATION IN THE UNITED STATES</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Those who first lived on this land, the Native American peoples,
            believed in general that land was held in common, not to be
            individually owned, fenced, or tamed. The white settlers from
            Europe had very different views of land. Some believed the New
            World was a Garden of Eden. It was a land of opportunity for them,
            but it was also a land to be controlled and subdued. Ideas on how
            to treat the land often followed those of European thinkers like
            John Locke, who believed that “Land that is left wholly to nature
            is called, as indeed it is, waste.” <sup>14</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The 1800s brought another way of approaching the land. Thinkers
            such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Muir, and Henry David Thoreau
            celebrated our human connection with nature. By the end of the
            1800s, some scientists and policymakers were noticing the damage
            humans have caused to the land. Leading public officials preached
            stewardship and wise use of our country’s resources. In 1873,
            Yellowstone National Park was set up. In 1903, the first National
            Wildlife Refuge was established.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, most of the government practices until the middle of the
            20<sup>th </sup>century favored unregulated development and use of
            the land’s resources. Forests were clear cut, rivers were dammed,
            wetlands were filled to create farmland, and factories were allowed
            to dump their untreated waste into rivers and lakes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1949, a forester and ecologist named Aldo Leopold revived the
            concept of preserving land for its own sake. But there was now a
            biological, or scientific, reason for conservation, not just a
            spiritual one. Leopold declared: “All ethics rest upon a single
            premise: that the individual is a member of a community of
            interdependent parts. . . . A thing is right when it tends to
            preserve the integrity and stability and beauty of the biotic
            community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.” <sup>15</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The fiery vision of these conservationists helped shape a more
            far-reaching movement that began in the 1960s. Many credit Rachel
Carson’s eloquent and accessible writings, such as her 1962 book            <em>Silent Spring</em>, with bringing environmental issues into
            people’s everyday language. When the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught
            fire in 1969 because it was so polluted, it captured the public
            attention. Conservation was no longer just about protecting land
            that many people would never even see, it was about protecting
            human health. The condition of the environment had become personal.
        </p>
        <p>
            In response to the public outcry about water and air pollution, the
            1970s saw the establishment of the EPA. Important legislation to
            protect the air and water was passed. National standards for a
            cleaner environment were set and programs were established to help
            achieve the ambitious goals. Conservation organizations grew from
            what had started as exclusive white men’s hunting clubs to interest
            groups with a broad membership base. People came together to demand
            changes that would afford more protection to the environment and to
            their health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the 1960s, some presidential administrations have sought to
            strengthen environmental protection and to protect more land and
            national treasures. For example, in 1980, President Jimmy Carter
            signed an act that doubled the amount of protected land in Alaska
            and renamed it the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Other
            administrations, like those of President Ronald Reagan, sought to
            dismantle many earlier environmental protection initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            The environmental movement, or environmentalism, is not one single,
            homogeneous cause. The agencies, individuals, and organizations
            that work toward protecting the environment vary as widely as the
            habitats and places they seek to protect. There are individuals who
            begin grass-roots efforts—people like Lois Marie Gibbs, a former
            resident of the polluted area of Love Canal, New York, who founded
            the Center for Health, Environment and Justice. There are
            conservation organizations, like The Nature Conservancy, the World
            Wildlife Fund (WWF), and Conservation International, that sponsor
            programs to preserve and protect habitats. There are groups that
            specialize in monitoring public policy and legislation—for example,
            the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense. In
            addition, there are organizations like the Audubon Society and the
            National Wildlife Federation whose focus is on public education
            about environmental issues. Perhaps from this diversity, just like
            there exists in a healthy ecosystem, will come the strength and
            vision environmentalism needs to deal with the continuing issues of
            the 21<sup>st </sup>century.

            <strong>INTERNATIONAL CONSERVATION EFFORTS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In his book <em>Biodiversity</em>, E. O. Wilson cautions that
            biological diversity must be taken seriously as a global resource
            for three reasons. First, human population growth is accelerating
            the degrading of the environment, especially in tropical countries.
            Second, science continues to discover new uses for biological
            diversity—uses that can benefit human health and protect the
            environment. And third, much biodiversity is being lost through
            extinction, much of it in the tropics. As Wilson states, “We must
            hurry to acquire the knowledge on which a wise policy of
conservation and development can be based for centuries to come.”            <sup>16</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            People organize themselves within boundaries and borders. But
            oceans, rivers, air, and wildlife do not follow such rules.
            Pollution or overfishing in one part of an ocean can easily degrade
            the quality of another country’s resources. If one country diverts
            a river, it can destroy another country’s wetlands or water
            resources. When Wilson cautions us that we must hurry to develop a
            wise conservation policy, he means a policy that will protect
            resources all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            To accomplish this will require countries to work together on
            critical global issues: preserving biodiversity, reducing global
            warming, decreasing air pollution, and protecting the oceans. There
            are many important international efforts already going on to
            protect the resources of our planet. Some efforts are regulatory,
            while others are being pursued by nongovernmental organizations or
            private conservation groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Countries volunteering to cooperate to protect resources is not a
            new idea. In 1946, a group of countries established the
            International Whaling Commission (IWC). They recognized that
            unregulated whaling around the world had led to severe declines in
            the world’s whale populations. In 1986, the IWC declared a
            moratorium on whaling, which is still in effect, until the
            populations have recovered.<sup>17 </sup>Another example of
            international cooperation occurred in 1987 when various countries
            signed the Montreal Protocol to reduce the emissions of
            ozone-depleting gases. It has been a huge success, and perhaps has
            served as a model for other international efforts, like the 1997
            Kyoto Protocol, to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet another example of international environmental cooperation is
            the CITES agreement (the Convention on International Trade in
            Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), a legally binding
            agreement to ensure that the international trade of plants and
            animals does not threaten the species’ survival. CITES went into
            force in 1975 after 80 countries agreed to the terms. Today, it has
            grown to include more than 160 countries. This make
        </p>
        <p>
            CITES among the largest conservation agreements in existence.

            <sup>8</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Another show of international conservation efforts are governments
            developing economic incentives for local conservation. For example,
            in 1996, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
            Wildlife Fund (WWF) established a program to relieve poor countries
            of debt. More than 40 countries have benefited by agreeing to
            direct some of their savings toward environmental programs in the
            “Debtfor-Nature” swap programs.<sup>19</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is worth our time to consider the thoughts of two American
            conservationists and what role we, as individuals, can play in
            conserving and protecting our world. E. O. Wilson has told us that
            “Biological Diversity—‘biodiversity’ in the new parlance—is the key
            to the maintenance of the world as we know it.”

            Aldo Leopold, the forester who gave Americans the idea of creating
            a “land ethic,” wrote in 1949 that: “Having to squeeze the last
            drop of utility out of the land has the same desperate finality as
having to chop up the furniture to keep warm<em>.</em>”            <sup>21 </sup>All of us have the ability to take part in the

                Why Is Polluted Water an Issue in the United States and All

                            What does clean water have to do with you? Well, to
                            start with, your body is about three-quarters
                            water. The food you eat is grown with water. The
                            oxygen you breathe is generated by plants that use
                            water. These same plants clean the air you breathe.
                            And some things you might like to do require clean
                            water—swimming, cooking, and showering are
                            examples. If all water were polluted, living
                            things, including you, would get sick. Somewhere in
                            the world, a child dies every eight seconds from a
                            disease related to contaminated water.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many sources of water pollution: direct
                            discharges by industry, sewage, leaking underground
                            storage tanks, and landfills are some point
                            sources. But a major source of pollution comes from
                            sources that are harder to pinpoint, and,
                            therefore, harder to control.These nonpoint
                            sources, as they are called, include run-off that
                            contains fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides
                            from agricultural lands and drainage from paved
                            surfaces and storm drains.Another source is not
                            quite as obvious, but is deadly serious. Pollution
                            from the air falls to the water as acid rain,
                            killing lakes and causing harmful substances such
                            as mercury to accumulate in fish.

                            Polluted water is not a problem in the United
                            States alone.The United Nations (UN) declared 2003
                            the international year of fresh water, as an effort
                            to rally international and regional support for
water issues. The first article that follows,                            <em>The Quest for Clean Water</em>, identifies some
                            global water issues and examines what is being done
                            to address them. The second excerpt, from a 2003

        <p>
            In the 1890s, entrepreneur William Love sought to establish a model
            industrial community in the La Salle district of Niagara Falls, New
            York. The plan included building a canal that tapped water from the
            Niagara River for a navigable waterway and a hydroelectric power
            plant. Although work on the canal was begun, a nationwide economic
            depression and other factors forced abandonment of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 1920, the land adjacent to the canal was sold and used as a
            landfill for municipal and industrial wastes. Later purchased by
            Hooker Chemicals and Plastics Corp.,the landfill became a dumping
            ground for nearly 21,000 tons of mixed chemical wastes before being
            closed and covered over in the early 1950s.Shortly thereafter, the
            property was acquired by the Niagara Falls Board of Education, and
            schools and residences were built on and around the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the ensuing decades, groundwater levels in the area rose, parts
            of the landfill subsided, large metal drums of waste were
            uncovered, and toxic chemicals oozed out. All this led to the
            contamination of surface waters,oily residues in residential
            basements, corrosion of sump pumps,and noxious odors.Residents
            began to question if these problems were at the root of an apparent
            prevalence of birth defects and miscarriages in the neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually, in 1978, the area was declared unsafe by the New York
            State Department of Health, and President Jimmy Carter approved
            emergency federal assistance. The school located on the landfill
            site was closed and nearby houses were condemned. State and federal
            agencies worked together to relocate hundreds of residents and
            contain or destroy the chemical wastes.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was the bitter story of Love Canal. Although not the worst
            environmental disaster in U.S. history, it illustrates the tragic
            consequences of water pollution.

        <strong>WATER QUALITY STANDARDS</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to toxic chemical wastes, water pollutants occur in many
        other forms, including pathogenic microbes (harmful bacteria and
        viruses), excess fertilizers (containing compounds of phosphorus and
        nitrogen), and trash floating on streams, lakes, and beaches. Water
        pollution can also take the form of sediment eroded from stream banks,
        large blooms of algae, low levels of dissolved oxygen, or abnormally
        high temperatures (from the discharge of coolant water at power
        plants).
    </p>
    <p>
        The United States has seen a growing concern about water pollution
        since the middle of the twentieth century, as the public recognized
        that pollutants were adversely affecting human health and rendering
        lakes unswimmable, streams unfishable, and rivers flammable. In
        response, in 1972, Congress passed the Federal Water Pollution Control
        Act Amendments, later modified and referred to as the Clean Water Act.
        Its purpose was to “restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and
        biological integrity of the nation’s waters.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The Clean Water Act set the ambitious national goal of completely
        eliminating the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters by 1985,
        as well as the interim goal of making water clean enough to sustain
        fish and wildlife, while being safe for swimming and boating. To
        achieve these goals, certain standards for water quality were
        established.
    </p>
    <p>
        The “designated uses” of every body of water subject to the act must
        first be identified. Is it a source for drinking water? Is it used for
        recreation, such as swimming? Does it supply agriculture or industry?
        Is it a significant habitat for fish and other aquatic life?
        Thereafter, the water must be tested for pollutants. If it fails to
        meet the minimum standards for its designated uses, then steps must be
        taken to limit pollutants entering it, so that it becomes suitable for
        those uses.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the global level, the fundamental importance of clean water has come
        into the spotlight. In November 2002, the UN Committee on Economic,
        Cultural and Social Rights declared access to clean water a human
        right. Moreover, the United Nations has designated 2003 to be the
        International Year of Freshwater, with the aim of encouraging
        sustainable use of freshwater and integrated water resources
        management.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>HERE, THERE, AND EVERYWHERE</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Implementing the Clean Water Act requires clarifying the sources of
        pollutants. They are divided into two groups: “point sources” and
        “nonpoint sources.” Point sources correspond to discrete, identifiable
        locations from which pollutants are emitted. They include factories,
        wastewater treatment plants, landfills, and underground storage tanks.
        Water pollution that originates at point sources is usually what is
        associated with headline-grabbing stories such as those about Love
        Canal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nonpoint sources of pollution are diffuse and therefore harder to
        control. For instance, rain washes oil, grease, and solid pollutants
        from streets and parking lots into storm drains that carry them into
        bays and rivers. Likewise, irrigation and rainwater leach fertilizers,
        herbicides, and insecticides from farms and lawns and into streams and
        lakes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The direct discharge of wastes from point sources into lakes, rivers,
        and streams is regulated by a permit program known as the National
        Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). This program,
        established through the Clean Water Act, is administered by the
        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and authorized states. By
        regulating the wastes discharged, NPDES has helped reduce point-source
        pollution dramatically. On the other hand, water pollution in the
        United States is now mainly from nonpoint sources, as reported by the
        EPA.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1991, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, part of the Department of
        the Interior) began a systematic, long-term program to monitor
        watersheds. The National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA),
        established to help manage surface and groundwater supplies, has
        involved the collection and analysis of water quality data in over 50
        major river basins and aquifer systems in nearly all 50 states.
    </p>
    <p>
        The program has encompassed three principal categories of
        investigation: (1) the current conditions of surface water and
        groundwater; (2) changes in those conditions over time; and (3) major
        factors—such as climate, geography, and land use— that affect water
        quality. For each of these categories, the water and sediment have been
        tested for such pollutants as pesticides, plant nutrients, volatile
        organic compounds, and heavy metals.
    </p>
    <p>
        The NAWQA findings were disturbing. Water quality is most affected in
        watersheds with highest population density and urban development. In
        agricultural areas, 95 percent of tested streams and 60 percent of
        shallow wells contained herbicides, insecticides, or both. In urban
        areas, 99 percent of tested streams and 50 percent of shallow wells had
        herbicides, especially those used on lawns and golf courses.
        Insecticides were found more frequently in urban streams than in
        agricultural ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        The study also found large amounts of plant nutrients in water
        supplies. For instance, 80 percent of agricultural streams and 70
        percent of urban streams were found to contain phosphorus at
        concentrations that exceeded EPA guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, in agricultural areas, one out of five well-water samples had
        nitrate concentrations higher than EPA standards for drinking water.
        Nitrate contamination can result from nitrogen fertilizers or material
        from defective septic systems leaching into the groundwater, or it may
        reflect defects in the wells.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>EFFECTS OF POLLUTION</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the UN World Water Assessment Programme, about 2.3 billion
        people suffer from diseases associated with polluted water, and more
        than 5 million people die from these illnesses each year. Dysentery,
        typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis A are some of the ailments that result
        from ingesting water contaminated with harmful microbes. Other
        illnesses—such as malaria, filariasis, yellow fever, and sleeping
        sickness—are transmitted by vector organisms (such as mosquitoes and
        tsetse flies) that breed in or live near stagnant, unclean water.
    </p>
    <p>
        A number of chemical contaminants—including DDT, dioxins,
        polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and heavy metals— are associated with
        conditions ranging from skin rashes to various cancers and birth
        defects. Excess nitrate in an infant’s drinking water can lead to the
        “blue baby syndrome” (methemoglobinemia)—a condition in which the
        child’s digestive system cannot process the nitrate, diminishing the
        blood’s ability to carry adequate concentrations of oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides affecting human health, water pollution has adverse effects on
        ecosystems. For instance, while moderate amounts of nutrients in
        surface water are generally not problematic, large quantities of
        phosphorus and nitrogen compounds can lead to excessive growth of algae
        and other nuisance species. Known as <em>eutrophication, </em>this
        phenomenon reduces the penetration of sunlight through the water; when
        the plants die and decompose, the body of water is left with odors, bad
        taste, and reduced levels of dissolved oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Low levels of dissolved oxygen can kill fish and shellfish. In
        addition, aquatic weeds can interfere with recreational activities
        (such as boating and swimming) and can clog intake by industry and
        municipal systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some pollutants settle to the bottom of streams, lakes, and harbors,
        where they may remain for many years. For instance, although DDT and
        PCBs were banned years ago, they are still found in sediments in many
        urban and rural streams. They occur at levels harmful to wildlife at
        more than two-thirds of the urban sites tested.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>PREVENTION AND REMEDIATION</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        As the old saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
        cure. This is especially true when it comes to controlling water
        pollution. Several important steps taken since the passage of the Clean
        Water Act have made surface waters today cleaner in many ways than they
        were 30 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, industrial wastes are mandated to be neutralized or broken
        down before being discharged to streams, lakes, and harbors. Moreover,
        the U.S. government has banned the production and use of certain
        dangerous pollutants such as DDT and PCBs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, two major changes have been introduced in the handling of
        sewage. First, smaller, less efficient sewage treatment plants are
        being replaced with modern, regional plants that include biological
        treatment, in which microorganisms are used to break down organic
        matter in the sewage. The newer plants are releasing much cleaner
        discharges into the receiving bodies of water (rivers, lakes, and
        ocean).
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, many jurisdictions throughout the United States are building
        separate sewer lines for storm water and sanitary wastes. These
        upgrades are needed because excess water in the older, “combined” sewer
        systems would simply bypass the treatment process, and untreated sewage
        would be discharged directly into receiving bodies of water.
    </p>
    <p>
        To minimize pollutants from nonpoint sources, the EPA is requiring all
        municipalities to address the problem of runoff from roads and parking
        lots. At the same time, the use of fertilizers and pesticides needs to
        be reduced. Toward this end, county extension agents are educating
        farmers and homeowners about their proper application and the
        availability of nutrient testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        To curtail the use of expensive and potentially harmful pesticides, the
        approach known as <em>integrated pest management </em>can be
        implemented. It involves the identification of specific pest problems
        and the use of nontoxic chemicals and chemicalfree alternatives
        whenever possible. For instance, aphids can be held in check by ladybug
        beetles and caterpillars can be controlled by applying neem oil to the
        leaves on which they feed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, new urban development projects in many areas are required to
        implement storm-water management practices. They include such features
        as oil and grease traps in storm drains; swales to slow down runoff,
        allowing it to infiltrate back into groundwater; “wet” detention basins
        (essentially artificial ponds) that allow solids to settle out of
        runoff; and artificial wetlands that help break down contaminants in
        runoff. While such additions may be costly, they significantly improve
        water quality. They are of course much more expensive to install after
        those areas have been developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a waterway is polluted, cleanup is often expensive and time
        consuming. For instance, to increase the concentration of dissolved
        oxygen in a lake that has undergone eutrophication, fountains and
        aerators may be necessary. Specially designed boats may be needed to
        harvest nuisance weeds.
    </p>
    <p>
        At times, it is costly just to identify the source of a problem. For
        example, if a body of water contains high levels of coliform bacteria,
        expensive DNA testing may be needed to determine whether the bacteria
        came from leakage of human sewage, pet waste, or the feces of waterfowl
        or other wildlife.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contaminated sediments are sometimes difficult to treat. Available
        techniques range from dredging the sediments to “capping” them in
        place, to limit their potential exposure. Given that they act as
        reservoirs of pollutants, it is often best to remove the sediments and
        burn off the contaminants. Alternatively, the extracted sediments may
        be placed in confined disposal areas that prevent the pollutants from
        leaching back into groundwater. Dredging, however, may create
        additional problems by releasing pollutants back into the water column
        when the sediment is stirred up.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>THE FUTURE OF CLEAN WATER</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The EPA reports that as a result of the Clean Water Act, millions of
        tons of sewage and industrial waste are being treated before they are
        discharged into U.S. coastal waters. In addition, the majority of lakes
        and rivers now meet mandated water quality goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet the future of federal regulation under the Clean Water Act is
unclear. In 2001, a Supreme Court decision (<em>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County </em>v.        <em>United States Army Corps of Engineers, et al.</em>) brought into
        question the power of federal agencies to regulate activities affecting
        water quality in smaller, nonnavigable bodies of water. This and
        related court decisions have set the stage for the EPA and other
        federal agencies to redefine which bodies of water can be protected
        from unregulated dumping and discharges under the Clean Water Act. As a
        result, individual states may soon be faced with much greater
        responsibility for the protection of water resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        Worldwide, more than one billion people presently lack access to clean
        water sources, and over two billion live without basic sanitation
        facilities. A large proportion of those who die from water-related
        diseases are infants. We would hope that by raising awareness of these
        issues on an international level, the newly recognized right to clean
        water will become a reality for a much larger percentage of the world’s
        population.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>TRAGEDY AT MINAMATA BAY</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Chisso chemical factory, located on the Japanese island of Kyushu,
        is believed to have discharged between 70 and 150 tons of methylmercury
        (an organic form of mercury) into Minamata Bay between 1932 and 1968.
        The factory, a dominant presence in the region, used the chemical to
        manufacture acetic acid and vinyl chloride.
    </p>
    <p>
        Methylmercury is easily absorbed upon ingestion, causing widespread
        damage to the central nervous system. Symptoms include numbing and
        unsteadiness of extremities, failure of muscular coordination, and
        impairment of speech, hearing, and vision. Exposure to high levels of
        the substance can be fatal. In addition, the effects are magnified for
        infants exposed to methylmercury through their mothers, both before
        birth and while nursing.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the 1960s and ’70s, it was revealed that thousands of Minamata Bay
        residents had been exposed to methylmercury. The chemical had been
        taken up from the bay’s waters by its fish and then made its way into
        the birds, cats, and people who ate the fish. Consequently,
        methylmercury poisoning came to be called Minamata disease.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remediation, which took as long as 14 years, involved removing the
        mercury-filled sediments and containing them on reclaimed land in
        Minamata Bay. Fish in the bay had such high levels of methylmercury
        that they had to be prevented from leaving the bay by a huge net, which
        was in place from 1974 to 1997.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mercury poisoning has recently appeared in the Amazon basin, where
        deforestation has led to uncontrolled runoff of natural accumulations
        of mercury from the soil into rivers and streams. In the United States,
        testing has revealed that predator fish such as bass and walleye in
        certain lakes and rivers contain enough mercury to justify warnings
        against consuming them in large amounts.

            THE IMPORTANCE OF FOREST PROTECTED AREAS TO DRINKING WATER
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Introduction: What Do City Dwellers Need?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the past 100 years the world population tripled, but water use for
        human purposes multiplied sixfold! Water is, in theory, a
        quintessentially renewable resource. Most of the world’s surface is
        covered in water and over much of the world it falls, unbidden and with
        great regularity, from the skies. Yet, the carelessness and profligacy
        with which water resources have been used, the speed of human
        population growth and the increasing per capita demands for water
        together mean that provision of adequate, safe supplies of water is now
        a major source of concern, expense and even international tension. At
        the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002,
        over 80 per cent of the participating decision-makers identified water
        as a key issue to be addressed by Heads of State from countries
        throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, the greatest human requirement for freshwater resources is for
        crop irrigation, particularly in places where farming takes place in
        arid regions and in the great rice paddy fields of Asia. Municipal
        water—the focus of the current study—accounts for less than a tenth of
        human water use. But the need for clean drinking water is of critical
        importance to the growing proportion of the world’s population that
        live in cities. Wherever a breakdown in water supply occurs, because of
        disasters like earthquakes, floods, wars or civil unrest, immediate and
        acute problems occur and reliance on contaminated water results in the
        rapid spread of diseases like cholera and infant diarrhoea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, for many people there is no need for a disaster to make
        them dependent on unclean drinking water. Today, around half of the
        world’s population lives in towns and cities, and of this urban
        population one third, an estimated one billion people, live without
        clean water or adequate sanitation, despite these services widely being
        regarded as basic prerequisites of a decent life. These one billion
        extreme havenots are unevenly distributed around the world. Regionally,
        it has been estimated that 700 million people in urban Asia, or half
        the urban population, do not have adequate water supplies; nor do 150
        million people in Africa, again about 50 per cent of the city dwellers;
        with a further 120 million people, about 30 per cent of the urban
        population, lacking clean water in Latin America and the Caribbean.
        Many people die each year as a direct result. Annually, 2.2 million
        deaths, four per cent of all fatalities worldwide, can be attributed to
        inadequate supplies of clean water and sanitation.
    </p>
    <p>
        These problems are likely to increase in the future as the current
        rapid processes of population growth and urbanisation continue. The
        average size of the world’s 100 largest cities grew from around 0.2
        million in 1800 to 6.2 million in 2000. In 1900, there were estimated
        to be just 43 cities worldwide with a population of over half a
        million, by 1990 this figure had risen to around 800 cities
        worldwide—of which some 270 had more than one million and 14 had over
        10 million. These trends are likely to continue for some time. Most
        current estimates suggest that the world’s population will grow by two
        billion people over the next 30 years and another billion in the
        following 20 years. Virtually, all of these increases will be in
        developing countries, the bulk of which will occur in urban areas. In
        India, for example, World Bank forecasts are that demand for water in
        the urban and industrial sectors is likely to increase by 135 percent
        over the next 40 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        In many arid countries, there is already an acute supply shortage.
        World water withdrawals rose sixfold over the last century. It has been
        estimated that humanity now uses 54 per cent of accessible runoff, a
        figure that could rise to 70 per cent by 2005. For several countries,
        current reliance on nonrenewable (or only very slowly renewable)
        groundwater sources masks a problem that could rapidly become more
        acute as these are exhausted.Because of population growth,the average
        annual per capita availability of renewable water resources is
        projected to fall from 6,600 cubic metres [8,633 cubic yards] today to
        4,800 cubic metres [6,278 cubic yards] in 2025. In 1998, 28 countries
        experienced water stress or scarcity (defined when available water is
        lower than 1,000 cubic meters [1,308 cubic yards] per person per year).
        By 2025, this number is predicted to rise to 56. As the number of
        people in urban areas grows, so does the demand for water, food and for
        irrigation in agricultural areas close to the city adding further
        pressures on water resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        The demand for water, along with increasing pressures on water from
        pollution, urbanisation and overexploitation of aquatic resources, is
        also creating a biodiversity crisis in
    </p>
    <p>
        freshwaters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although future supply problems are expected, with a few notable
        exceptions the current shortfall in clean water for city dwellers is
        seldom to do with a real lack of supply but more related to poor
        distribution, inadequate treatment and to some extent also poor
        education and a lack of understanding about the problems. For example,
        up to 50 per cent of the urban water in many African cities is being
        wasted through leakage, theft or is otherwise unaccounted for.
        (Conversely Melbourne, after a seven year period of extreme drought, is
        still supplying its citizens with some of the best quality drinking
        water in the world.) Efforts are being made to address these problems.
        Over the past 20 years for instance more than 2.4 billion people have
        gained access to water supply and 600 million to sanitation. The United
        Nations Millennium Summit in 2000 agreed to reduce halve the 1.1
        billion people who do not have access to safe water by 2015, as part of
        its Millennium Development Goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cities therefore face immediate problems of access to clean water and
        sanitation and mounting problems of supply. In recent years, increasing
        interest has been taken in the opportunities for maintaining urban
        water supplies (and perhaps even more importantly water quality)
        through management of natural resources.Unfortunately,the links often
        come into focus when something goes wrong—most commonly when resource
        management upstream has downstream impacts in terms of changes in water
        supply, increased flooding and reduced water quality. The majority of
        the world’s population live downstream of forested watersheds and
        therefore are susceptible to the costs of watershed degradation.At the
        same time, 28 percent of the world’s forest areas are in mountains, and
        mountains are the source of some 60 to 80 percent of the world’s
        freshwater resources. Hence the importance of this report.
    </p>
    <p>
        The protected areas and protected forests identified below all play a
        role in providing drinking water for the world’s biggest cities. More
        often than not this water also helps feed the people, through
        irrigation of crops, provide electricity through hydro-electric plants,
        and has a recreation, aesthetic and even religious function. Of course
        protected areas are just one tool in a range of watershed conservation
        models, that can have costs of their own, but it is hoped that by
        highlighting their role this report will add to the growing literature
        extolling the benefits of long-term protection to some of the world’s
        most important resource areas.

                        scientific data to local, state, and government

                        The NAWQA study looked at the current quality of water
                        resources, how conditions have changed over time, and
                        major factors (such as climate, land use, and
                        topography) that affect water quality. It found that
                        contamination of streams and groundwater is widespread
                        in both agricultural and urban areas. It also showed
                        that water quality and aquatic ecosystem health are
                        “controlled by a combination of factors, including
                        chemical use, land use, land-management practices, and

                        of surface water, groundwater, land, and air affects
                        the flow of water and contaminants in aquatic
                        ecosystems. Not surprisingly, water quality is most
                        impacted in areas that have larger human populations.

                        The study clearly shows that water quality is still an
                        important issue, and that the goals of the 1972 Clean

            INFORMATION TO MANAGE, PROTECT, AND RESTORE WATER QUALITY
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program of the U.S.
        Geological Survey (USGS) assesses the quality of streams, ground water,
        and aquatic ecosystems in major river basins and aquifer systems across
        the Nation. These assessments characterize the ambient water
        resource—the source for more than 60 percent of the Nation’s drinking
        water and water for irrigation and industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        During its first decade (1991–2001), NAWQA completed assessments in 51
        study units, which provided baseline data and information on the
        occurrence of pesticides, nutrients, volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
        trace elements, and radon in water, and on the condition of aquatic
        habitats and fish, insect, and algal communities. Conditions are
        compared to selected benchmarks, such as for drinkingwater quality and
        the protection of aquatic organisms. Each assessment follows a
        nationally consistent study design and methodology, thereby providing
        information about local water-quality conditions as well as providing
        insight on where and when water quality varies regionally and
        nationally. This document contains findings of regional and national
        interest along with examples from the study units illustrating these
        findings.
    </p>
    <p>
        During its second decade (2002–2012), NAWQA plans to reassess 42 of the
        51 study units. These assessments will fill critical gaps in the
        characterization of water-quality conditions; determine trends at many
        of the monitoring sites; and build upon earlier assessments that link
        water-quality conditions and trends to natural and human factors. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
        The first round of NAWQA assessments indicates that while many of our
        Nation’s waters are suitable for most uses, contaminants from nonpoint
        and point sources continue to affect our streams and ground water in
        parts of every study unit. Findings from the 51 study units show that •
        contamination of streams and ground water is widespread in agricultural
        and urban areas, and is characterized by complex mixtures of nutrients,
        trace elements, pesticides, VOCs, and their chemical breakdown
        products, and
    </p>
    <p>
        • water quality and aquatic-ecosystem health are controlled by a
        combination of factors, including chemical use, land use,
        land-management practices, and natural features, such as geology,
        hydrology, soils,
    </p>
    <p>
        and climate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Local, state, tribal, and national stakeholders use NAWQA information
        to design and implement strategies for managing, protecting, and
        monitoring water resources in many different hydrologic and land-use
        settings across the Nation, such as to:
    </p>
    <p>
        • support development of regulations, standards, and guidelines that
        reflect actual contaminant occurrence, including contaminant mixtures,
        breakdown products, seasonal patterns, and variability among different
        settings;
    </p>
    <p>
        • identify key sources of nonpoint pollution in agricultural and urban
        areas;
    </p>
    <p>
        • prioritize geographic areas and basins in which water resources and
        aquatic ecosystems are most vulnerable to contamination and where
        improved treatment or management can have the greatest
    </p>
    <p>
        benefits;
    </p>
    <p>
        • improve strategies and protocols for monitoring, sampling, and
        analysis of all hydrologic components, including the atmosphere,
        surface water, ground water, and biological communities;
    </p>
    <p>
        • contribute to State assessments of beneficial uses and impaired
        waters (Total Maximum Daily Loads or TMDLs), strategies for
        source-water protection and management, pesticide and nutrient
        management plans, and fish-consumption advisories; and, • sustain the
        health of aquatic ecosystems through improved stream protection and
        restoration
    </p>
    <p>
        management.
    </p>
    <p>
        NAWQA studies indicate that contaminants are widespread, albeit often
        at low concentrations, in river basins and aquifer systems across a
        wide range of landscapes and land uses. In the mostly agricultural
        Lower Tennessee River Basin, for example, 52 different pesticides were
        detected in streams and rivers, and VOCs were detected in about 67
        percent of sampled springs and wells that tap underlying carbonate
        aquifers. Nationally, at least one pesticide was found in about 94
        percent of water samples and in 90 percent of fish samples from
        streams, and in about 55 percent of shallow wells sampled in
        agricultural and urban areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        The type and concentrations of contaminants that are found in urban and
        agricultural water resources are closely related to the chemicals that
        are used (such as fertilizers and pesticides) or that are released with
        waste products (such as sewage or manure). For example, phosphorus and
        many insecticides, such as diazinon, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, and
        malathion, were detected more frequently and usually at higher
        concentrations in urban streams than in agricultural streams.
        Nationally, at least one pesticide guideline established to protect
        aquatic life was exceeded in nearly all (about 93 percent) of the urban
        streams sampled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nitrogen and many herbicides—most commonly atrazine and its breakdown
        product deethylatrazine (DEA), metolachlor, alachlor, and
        cyanazine—generally were detected more frequently and usually at higher
        concentrations in streams and shallow ground water in agricultural
        areas than in urban areas. Occurrence is linked to use; these
        herbicides rank in the top five used for agriculture. Concentrations of
        nitrate exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
        drinking-water standard of 10 milligrams per liter in samples collected
        from about 20 percent of shallow wells in agricultural areas (versus
        about 3 percent in urban areas).
    </p>
    <p>
        VOCs were detected frequently in shallow ground water beneath urban
        areas (in about 90 percent of monitoring wells sampled) and less
        frequently in shallow ground water beneath agricultural areas (in 20
        percent of monitoring wells). Some of the most common VOCs in urban
        areas, such as in the Delaware River Basin, were the solvents
        trichloroethene (TCE), tetrachloroethene (PCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane
        (TCA), and trichloromethane (also known as chloroform), which is also a
        disinfection by-product of water treatment; and the gasolinerelated
        compounds benzene, toluene, xylene, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).
    </p>
    <p>
        New pesticides, VOCs, and other synthetic chemicals are introduced into
        the environment every year as products are approved for agricultural or
        urban use. USGS has expanded its laboratory methods to analyze for
        these “emerging”contaminants, testing new methods in areas where their
        use is the greatest.

        <strong>Implications</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Reducing chemical use and improving disposal practices can help reduce
        contaminant concentrations in both urban and agricultural settings.
        More information about chemical use— data that are virtually
        unavailable in urban areas—is critical to linking contaminants to their
        sources, thus helping individuals, businesses, and industry as well as
        local, State, and Federal governments to improve water quality.

        <strong>INTERACTIONS AMONG WATER, AIR, AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS </strong>
        Interactions among surface water, ground water, land, and the
        atmosphere govern the occurrence and movement of water and
        contaminants, and thus affect the health of aquatic ecosystems. NAWQA
        studies therefore include assessments of multiple components of the
        hydrologic system, including streams, rivers, and ground water within
        the study units; the atmosphere; and biological communities (primarily
        fish, aquatic invertebrates, and algae) and stream habitat.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SURFACE WATER AND GROUND WATER</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Ground-water discharge can influence the quality of streams and
        ultimately the receiving water. For example, ground water supplies
        about half of the water and nitrogen to streams in the Chesapeake Bay
        watershed and is therefore an important source of nitrogen to the
        Chesapeake Bay. Streams, in turn, can influence the quality of ground
        water. Contaminants generally are more prevalent and detected at higher
        concentrations in streams than in ground water. This is largely
        determined by chemical properties of contaminants and flow conditions—
        ground water typically is not vulnerable to contamination by compounds
        that attach to soils or that are unstable in water, and relatively long
        residence times along ground-water flow paths allow many chemicals to
        degrade, disperse, or be diluted before reaching a well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interactions between surface water and ground water are affected by
        natural features such as soils, geology, and hydrology, and by human
        activities such as ground-water pumping. Exchanges of water and
        contaminants can be rapid in areas underlain by carbonate rocks or by
        permeable and welldrained soils and sediment, such as sand and gravel.
        Pumping ground water can accelerate exchanges between streams and
        ground water. In some areas, concentrations of contaminants can
        decrease during these exchanges, such as when chemicals are sorbed onto
        soil particles or are transformed by chemical or biological processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ground-water and surface-water exchanges are substantial in carbonate
        aquifers near San Antonio, Texas. Major streams lose water to the
        Edwards aquifer as they flow across the highly permeable, faulted and
        fractured carbonate rocks of the aquifer outcrop. Although streams that
        recharge the aquifer originate in and flow through mostly undeveloped
        rangeland, some of them also flow through urbanized northern San
        Antonio.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Implications</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Ground-water contributions to streams and rivers can be substantial.
        For this reason, ground-water flow and quality should be considered in
        making decisions for stream protection, such as in establishing Total
        Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). Surface-water recharge to ground water
        also is important, particularly where public-supply wells are located
        near streams, and should be considered in source-water management and
        well-head protection programs.

                        The small streams and wetlands that are the sources of
                        rivers have ecological functions that are distinct from
                        larger systems. Because water flows downhill, what
                        happens where a river begins affects the quality of
                        water farther down the river. The science of this was
                        recognized in the Clean Water Act of 1972, which
                        included the small streams and wetlands in its
                        definition of waters to be protected. Unfortunately,
                        the fate of many of these streams and wetlands is
                        unclear as different government administrations change
                        the definitions of which wetlands and waterways should
                        be protected and which can be filled. And as more
                        streams and wetlands are filled or polluted, those that
                        remain are forced to play an even larger role.

                    <p>
                        Why, then, do small streams and wetlands matter? Some
                        small streams and wetlands act as filters for pollution
                        and sediment and recharge groundwater. Headwater
                        streams and small wetlands provide habitats for
                        specialized plant and animal communities.

                        , a report written by 11 experts from the American
                        Rivers and Sierra Club, small headwater streams
                        represent about three-quarters of the stream and river
                        channels in the United States. A problem is that many
                        of these streams do not appear on United States
                        Geological Survey (USGS) maps, as the state of Ohio
                        found. In doing its own survey, the state found that
                        headwater streams (smaller streams that feed into
                        rivers) make up 80% of Ohio’s total length of streams,
                        yet did not show up on any USGS maps. The following
                        report discusses the growing volume of scientific data
                        that show just how valuable small streams and the
                        wetlands around them really are.

            Where Rivers Are Born: The Scientific Imperative for Defending

        Our nation’s network of rivers, lakes and streams originates from
        amyriad of small streams and wetlands,many so small they do not appear
        on any map. Yet these headwater streams and wetlands exert critical
        influences on the character and quality of downstream waters. The
        natural processes that occur in such headwater systems benefit humans
        by mitigating flooding,maintaining water quality and quantity,
        recycling nutrients, and providing habitat for plants and animals. This
        paper summarizes the scientific basis for understanding that the health
        and productivity of rivers and lakes depends upon intact small streams
        and wetlands.
    </p>
    <p>
        Historically, federal agencies have interpreted the protections of the
        Clean Water Act to cover all the waters of the United States, including
        small streams and wetlands. Despite this, many of these ecosystems have
        been destroyed by agriculture, mining, development and other human
        activities. The extent to which small streams and wetlands should
        remain under the protection of the Clean Water Act is currently (2003)
        under consideration in federal agencies and Congress. Extensive
        scientific studies document the significance of these small systems and
        form the basis for this paper. Further references are provided at the
        end of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        We know from local/regional studies that small, or headwater, streams
        make up at least 80 percent of the nation’s stream network. However,
        scientists’ abilities to extend these local and regional studies to
        provide a national perspective is hindered by the absence of a
        comprehensive database that catalogs the full extent of streams in the
        United States. The topographic maps most commonly used to trace stream
        networks do not show most of the nation’s headwater streams and
        wetlands. Thus, such maps do not provide detailed enough information to
        serve as a basis for stream protection and management. Scientists often
        refer to the benefits humans receive from the

    natural functioning of ecosystems as ecosystem services. The special
    physical and biological characteristics of intact small streams and
    wetlands provide natural flood control, recharge groundwater, trap
    sediments and pollution from fertilizers, recycle nutrients, create and
    maintain biological diversity, and sustain the biological productivity of
    downstream rivers, lakes and estuaries. These ecosystem services are
    provided by seasonal as well as perennial streams and wetlands. Even when
    such systems have no visible overland connections to the stream network,
    small streams and wetlands are usually linked to the larger network through
    groundwater. Small streams and wetlands offer an enormous array of habitats
    for plant, animal and microbial life. Such small freshwater systems provide
    shelter, food, protection from predators, spawning sites and nursery areas,
    and travel corridors through the landscape. Many species depend on small
    streams and wetlands at some point in their life history. For example,
    headwater streams are vital for maintaining many of America’s fish species,
    including trout and salmon. Both perennial and seasonal streams and
    wetlands provide valuable habitat. Headwater streams and wetlands also
    provide a rich resource base that contributes to the productivity of both
    local food webs and those farther downstream. However, the unique and
    diverse biota of headwater systems is increasingly imperiled. Human-induced
    changes to such waters, including filling streams and wetlands, water
    pollution, and the introduction of exotic species, can diminish the
    biological diversity of such small freshwater systems, thereby also
    affecting downstream rivers and streams.
</p>
<p>
    Because small streams and wetlands are the source of the nation’s fresh
    waters, changes that degrade these headwater systems affect streams, lakes,
    and rivers downstream. Landuse changes in the vicinity of small streams and
    wetlands can impair the natural functions of such headwater systems.
    Changes in surrounding vegetation, development that paves and hardens soil
    surfaces, and the total elimination of some small streams reduces the
    amount of rainwater, runoff and snowmelt the stream network can absorb
    before flooding. The increased volume of water in small streams scours
    stream channels, changing them in a way that promotes further flooding.
    Such altered channels have bigger and more frequent floods. The altered
    channels are also less effective at recharging groundwater, trapping
    sediment, and recycling nutrients. As a result, downstream lakes and rivers
    have poorer water quality, less reliable water flows, and less diverse
    aquatic life. Algal blooms and fish kills can become more common, causing
    problems for commercial and sport fisheries. Recreational uses may be
    compromised. In addition, the excess sediment can be costly, requiring
    additional dredging to clear navigational channels and harbors and
    increasing water filtration costs for municipalities and industry.
</p>
<p>
    The natural processes that occur in small streams and wetlands provide
    Americans with a host of benefits, including flood control, adequate
    highquality water, and habitat for a variety of plants and animals.
    Scientific research shows that healthy headwater systems are critical to
    the healthy functioning of downstream streams, rivers, lakes and estuaries.
    To provide the ecosystem services that sustain the health of our nation’s
    waters, the hydrological, geological, and biological characteristics of
    small streams and wetlands require protection. . . .

    <strong>SMALL STREAMS AND WETLANDS </strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>PROVIDE BENEFICIAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Natural processes that occur in small streams and wetlands provide humans
    with a host of benefits, including flood control, maintenance of water
    quantity and quality, and habitat for a variety of plants and animals. For
    headwater streams and wetlands to provide ecosystem services that sustain
    the health of our nation’s waters, the hydrological, geological and
    biological components of stream networks must be intact.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Small Streams and Wetlands Provide Natural Flood Control</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Floods are a natural part of every river. In times past, waters of the
    Mississippi River routinely overtopped its banks.
</p>
<p>
    Floodwaters carried the sediment and nutrients that made the Mississippi
    Delta’s soil particularly suitable for agriculture. But floods can also
    destroy farms, houses, roads and bridges.
</p>
<p>
    When small streams and wetlands are in their natural state, they absorb
    significant amounts of rainwater, runoff and snowmelt before flooding.
    However, when a landscape is altered, such as by a landslide or large
    forest fire or a housing development, the runoff can exceed the absorption
    capacity of small streams. Moreover, the power of additional water coursing
    through a channel can change the channel itself. Humans often alter both
    landscape and stream channels in ways that result in larger and more
    frequent floods downstream.
</p>
<p>
    A key feature of streams and rivers is their shape. Unlike a concrete
    drainage ditch, a natural streambed does not present a smooth surface for
    water flow. Natural streambeds are rough and bumpy in ways that slow the
    passage of water. Particularly in small narrow streams, friction produced
    by a stream’s gravel bed, rocks, and dams of leaf litter and twigs slows
    water as it moves downstream. Slower moving water is more likely to seep
    into a stream’s natural water storage system—its bed and banks—and to
    recharge groundwater. Slower moving water also has less power to erode
    stream banks and carry sediment and debris downstream.
</p>
<p>
    In watersheds that are not carefully protected against impacts of land
    development, stream channels often become enlarged and incised from
    increased runoff. Changed channels send water downstream more quickly,
    resulting in more flooding. For example, after forests and prairies in
    Wisconsin watersheds were converted to agricultural fields, the size of
    floods increased. This change in land use had altered two parts of the
    river systems’ equation: the amount of runoff and shape of the stream
    channel. Cultivation destroyed the soil’s natural air spaces that came from
    worm burrows and plant roots. The resulting collapse of the soil caused
    more rainfall to run off into streams instead of soaking into the ground.
    Additional surface runoff then altered the stream channels, thereby
    increasing their capacity to carry large volumes of water quickly
    downstream. These larger volumes flow downstream at much higher velocity,
    rather than soaking into the streambed.
</p>
<p>
    Urbanization has similar effects; paving previously-vegetated areas leads
    to greater storm runoff, which changes urban stream channels and ultimately
    sends water more quickly downstream. Covering the land with impermeable
    surfaces, such as roofs, roads, and parking lots, can increase by several
    times the amount of runoff from a rainstorm. If land uses change near
    headwater streams, effects are felt throughout the stream network. In an
    urban setting, runoff is channeled into storm sewers, which then rapidly
    discharge large volumes of water into nearby streams. The additional water
    causes the stream to pick up speed, because deeper water has less friction
    with the streambed. The faster the water moves, the less it can soak into
    the streambed and banks. Faster water also erodes channel banks and beds,
    changing the shape of a channel. The effect is magnified downstream,
    because larger rivers receive water from tens, sometimes hundreds, of small
    headwater basins. When such changes are made near headwater streams,
    downstream portions of the stream network experience bigger and more
    frequent flooding.
</p>
<p>
    As regions become more urbanized, humans intentionally alter many natural
    stream channels by replacing them with storm sewers and other artificial
    conduits. When larger, smoother conduits are substituted for narrow,
    rough-bottomed natural stream channels, flood frequency increases
    downstream. For example, three decades of growth in storm sewers and paved
    surfaces around Watts Branch Creek, Maryland more than tripled the number
    of floods and increased average annual flood size by 23 percent.

    <strong>Small Streams and Wetlands Maintain Water Supplies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Headwater systems play a crucial role in ensuring a continual flow of water
    to downstream freshwater ecosystems. Water in streams and rivers comes from
    several sources: water held in the soil, runoff from precipitation, and
    groundwater. Water moves between the soil, streams and groundwater.
    Wetlands, even those without any obvious surface connection to streams, are
    also involved in such exchanges by storing and slowly releasing water into
    streams and groundwater, where it later resurfaces at springs. Because of
    these interactions, groundwater can contribute a significant portion of
    surface flow in streams and rivers; conversely, surface waters can also
    recharge groundwater. If connections between soil, water, surface waters,
    and groundwater are disrupted, streams, rivers, and wells can run dry.
    Two-thirds of Americans obtain their drinking water from a water system
    that uses surface water. The remaining one-third of the population relies
    on groundwater sources. The quality and amount of water in both of these
    sources respond to changes in headwater streams.
</p>
<p>
    USGS estimates that, on average, from 40 to 50 percent of water in streams
    and larger rivers comes from groundwater. In drier regions or during dry
    seasons, as much as 95 percent of a stream’s flow may come from
    groundwater. Thus, the recharge process that occurs in unaltered headwater
    streams and wetlands both moderates downstream flooding in times of high
    water and maintains stream flow during dry seasons.
</p>
<p>
    Headwater streams and wetlands have a particularly important role to play
    in recharge. These smallest upstream components of a river network have the
    largest surface area of soil in contact with available water, thereby
    providing the greatest opportunity for recharge of groundwater. Moreover,
    water level in headwater streams is often higher than the water table,
    allowing water to flow through the channel bed and banks into soil and
    groundwater. Such situations occur when water levels are high, such as
    during spring snowmelt or rainy seasons. During dry times, the situation in
    some reaches of the stream network, particularly those downstream, may
    reverse, with water flowing from the soil and groundwater through the
    channel banks and bed into the stream. This exchange of water from the soil
    and groundwater into the stream maintains stream flow. However, if land-use
    changes increase the amount of precipitation that runs off into a stream
    rather than soaking into the ground, the recharge process gets
    short-circuited. This increased volume of stream water flows rapidly
    downstream rather than infiltrating into soil and groundwater. The
    consequence is less overall groundwater recharge, which often results in
    less water in streams during drier seasons.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, alteration of small streams and wetlands disrupts the quantity
    and availability of water in a stream and river system. Protecting
    headwater streams and wetlands is important for maintaining water levels
    needed to support everything from fish to recreational boating to
    commercial ship traffic.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Small Streams and Wetlands Trap Excess Sediment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Headwater systems retain sediment. Like the flow of water, movement of
    sediment occurs throughout a river network. Thus, how a watershed is
    managed and what kinds of land uses occur there have substantial impact on
    the amount of sediment delivered to larger rivers downstream. Increased
    sediment raises water purification costs for municipal and industrial
    users, requires extensive dredging to maintain navigational channels, and
    degrades aquatic habitats. Intact headwater streams and wetlands can
    modulate the amount of sediment transported to downstream ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
    Runoff from rain, snowmelt and receding floodwaters can wash soil, leaves
    and twigs into streams, where the various materials get broken up into
    smaller particles or settle out. If natural vegetation and soil cover are
    disturbed by events and activities such as fires, farming or construction,
    runoff increases, washing more materials into streams. At the same time,
    the increased velocity and volume of water in a stream cause erosion within
    the streambed and banks themselves, contributing additional sediment to the
    stream system. Moreover, the faster, fuller stream can carry more and
    larger chunks of sediment further downstream.
</p>
<p>
    One study found that land disturbances such as urban construction can, at
    minimum, double the amount of sediment entering headwater streams from a
    watershed. A Pennsylvania study showed how, as a 160-acre [65-hectare]
    headwater watershed became more urbanized, channel erosion of a quartermile
    [0.4-km] stretch of stream generated 50,000 additional cubic feet [1,416
    cubic meters] of sediment in one year—enough to fill 25 moderate-sized
    living rooms. In a nonurban watershed of the same size, it would take five
    years to generate the same amount of sediment. Such studies demonstrate
    that landscape changes such as urbanization or agriculture, particularly
    without careful protection of headwater streams and their riparian zones,
    may cause many times more sediment to travel downstream.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Excess Sediment in Downstream Ecosystems Costs Money </strong>
    Keeping excess sediment out of downstream rivers and lakes is one ecosystem
    service intact small streams and wetlands provide. Once sediment moves
    further downstream, it becomes an expensive problem. Too much sediment can
    fill up reservoirs and navigation channels, damage commercial and sport
    fisheries, eliminate recreation spots, harm aquatic habitats and their
    associated plants and animals, and increase water filtration costs.
</p>
<p>
    Additional sediment damages aquatic ecosystems. Sediment suspended in the
    water makes it murkier; as a result, underwater plants no longer receive
    enough light to grow. Fish that depend on visual signals to mate may be
    less likely to spawn in murky water, thereby reducing fish populations.
    High levels of sediment suspended in water can even cause fish kills. Even
    as it settles to the bottom, sediment continues to cause problems because
    it fills the holes between gravel and stones that some animals call home,
    smothers small organisms that form the basis of many food webs, and can
    also smother fish eggs.
</p>
<p>
    Getting rid of sediment is expensive. For example, keeping Baltimore Harbor
    navigable costs $10 to $11.5 million annually to dredge and dispose of
    sediment the Patapsco River deposits in the harbor.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Small Streams and Wetlands Retain Sediment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Headwater streams and wetlands typically trap and retain much of the
    sediment that washes into them. The faster the water travels, the larger
    the particles it can carry. So, natural obstructions in small streams,
    rocks, downed logs, or even just a bumpy stream bottom slow water and cause
    sediment to settle out of the water column. Wetlands, whether or not they
    have a surface connection to a nearby stream, are often areas where runoff
    slows and stops,dropping any debris the water may be carrying. Because
    headwater streams represent 75 percent or more of total stream length in a
    stream network, such streams and their associated wetlands retain a
    substantial amount of sediment, preventing it from flowing into larger
    rivers downstream.
</p>
<p>
    Even ephemeral streams can retain significant amounts of sediment. Such
    small headwater streams expand and contract in response to heavy rains.
    During expansion, a stream flows over what was a dry or damp streambed.
    Most of the water at the leading edge of a growing stream, called the
    “trickle front,” soaks into the streambed and does not carry sediment
    downstream. In a small watershed near Corvallis, Oregon, researchers found
    that 60 to 80 percent of sediment generated from forest roads traveled less
    than 250 feet [76 meters] downstream before settling out in stream pools.
    Headwater streams can store sediment for long periods of time: research in
    Oregon’s Rock Creek basin found that headwater streams could retain
    sediment for 114 years.

    <strong>
        Natural Cleansing Ability of Small Streams and Wetlands Protects Water
        Quality
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Materials that wash into streams include everything from soil, leaves and
    dead insects to runoff from agricultural fields and animal pastures. One of
    the key ecosystem services that stream networks provide is the filtering
    and processing of such materials. Healthy aquatic ecosystems can transform
    natural materials like animal dung and chemicals such as fertilizers into
    less harmful substances. Small streams and their associated wetlands play a
    key role in both storing and modifying potential pollutants, ranging from
    chemical fertilizers to rotting salmon carcasses, in ways that maintain
    downstream water quality.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Excess Nutrients Cause Problems in Rivers and Lakes </strong>
    Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, the main chemicals in agricultural
    fertilizers, are essential nutrients not just for plants, but for all
    living organisms. However, in excess or in the wrong proportions, these
    chemicals can harm natural systems and humans.
</p>
<p>
    In freshwater ecosystems, eutrophication, the enriching of waters by excess
    nitrogen and phosphorus, reduces water quality in streams, lakes, estuaries
    and other downstream water bodies. One obvious result is the excessive
    growth of algae. More algae clouds previously clear streams, such as those
    favored by trout. In addition to reducing visibility, algal blooms reduce
    the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water, sometimes to a degree that
    causes fish kills. Fish are not the only organisms harmed: some of the
    algae species that grow in eutrophic waters generate tastes and odors or
    are toxic, a clear problem for stream systems that supply drinking water
    for municipalities. In addition, increased nitrogen can injure people and
    animals. Excess nitrogen in the form called nitrate in drinking water has
    been linked to “blue baby disease” (methemoglobinemia) in infants and also
    has toxic effects on livestock.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>HEADWATER STREAMS TRANSFORM AND STORE EXCESS NUTRIENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Headwater streams and associated wetlands both retain and transform excess
    nutrients, thereby preventing them from traveling downstream. Physical,
    chemical and biological processes in headwater streams interact to provide
    this ecosystem service.
</p>
<p>
    Compared with larger streams and rivers, small streams, especially shallow
    ones, have more water in physical contact with a stream channel. Therefore,
    the average distance traveled by a particle before it is removed from the
    water column is shorter in headwater streams than in larger ones. A study
    of headwater streams in the southern Appalachian Mountains found that both
    phosphorus and the nitrogen-containing compound ammonium traveled less than
    65 feet [20 meters] downstream before being removed from the water.
</p>
<p>
    In headwater streams and wetlands, more water is in direct contact with the
    streambed, where most processing takes place. Bacteria, fungi and other
    microorganisms living on the bottom of a stream consume inorganic nitrogen
    and phosphorus and convert them into less harmful, more biologically
    beneficial compounds. A mathematical model based on research in 14
    headwater streams throughout the U.S. shows that 64 percent of inorganic
    nitrogen entering a small stream is retained or transformed within 1,000
    yards [914 meters].
</p>
<p>
    Channel shape also plays a role in transforming excess nutrients. Studies
    in Pennsylvania have shown that when the forest surrounding headwaters is
    replaced by meadows or lawns, increased sunlight promotes growth of grasses
    along stream banks. The grasses trap sediments, create sod, and narrow the
    stream channel to one-third of the original width. Such narrowing reduces
    the amount of streambed available for microorganisms that process
    nutrients. As a result, nitrogen and phosphorus travel downstream five to
    ten times farther, increasing risks of eutrophication.
</p>
<p>
    Streams do not have to flow yearround to make significant contributions to
    water quality. Fertilizers and other pollutants enter stream systems during
    storms and other times of high runoff, the same times that ephemeral and
    intermittent streams are most likely to have water and process nutrients.
    Federal, state and local programs spend considerable sums of money to
    reduce non-point source inputs of nutrients because they are a major threat
    to water quality. One principal federal program, the EPA’s 319 cost-share
    program, awarded more than $1.3 billion between 1990 and 2001 to states and
    territories for projects to control non-point pollution. Failure to
    maintain nutrient removal capacity of ephemeral and intermittent streams
    and wetlands would undermine these efforts.
</p>
<p>
    Wetlands also remove nutrients from surface waters. Several studies of
    riparian wetlands have found that those associated with the smallest
    streams to be most effective in removing nutrients from surface waters. For
    example, headwater wetlands comprise 45 percent of all wetlands able to
    improve water quality in four Vermont watersheds. Another study found that
    wetlands associated with first-order streams are responsible for 90 percent
    of wetland phosphorus removal in eight northeastern watersheds. Such
    studies demonstrate that riparian wetlands, especially those associated
    with small streams, protect water quality.
</p>
<p>
    As land is developed, headwater streams are often filled or channeled into
    pipes or paved waterways, resulting in fewer and shorter streams. For
    example, as the Rock Creek watershed in Maryland was urbanized, more than
    half of the stream channel network was eliminated. In even more dramatic
    fashion, mining operations in the mountains of central Appalachia have
    removed mountain tops and filled valleys, wiping out entire headwater
    stream networks. From 1986 to 1998, more than 900 miles [1,448 km] of
    streams in central Appalachia were buried, more than half of them in West
    Virginia.
</p>
<p>
    If headwater streams and wetlands are degraded or filled, more fertilizer
    applied to farm fields or lawns reaches larger downstream rivers. These
    larger rivers process excess nutrients from fertilizer much more slowly
    than smaller streams. Losing the nutrient retention capacity of headwater
    streams would cause downstream water bodies to contain higher
    concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. A likely consequence of
    additional nutrients would be the further contamination and eutrophication
    of downstream rivers, lakes, estuaries and such waters as the Gulf of
    Mexico.

    <strong>
        Natural Recycling in Headwater Systems Sustains Downstream Ecosystems
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Recycling organic carbon contained in the bodies of dead plants and animals
    is a crucial ecosystem service. Ecological processes that transform
    inorganic carbon into organic carbon and recycle organic carbon are the
    basis for every food web on the planet. In freshwater ecosystems, much of
    the recycling happens in small streams and wetlands, where microorganisms
    transform everything from leaf litter and downed logs to dead salamanders
    into food for other organisms in the aquatic food web, including mayflies,
    frogs and salmon.
</p>
<p>
    Like nitrogen and phosphorus, carbon is essential to life but can be
    harmful to freshwater ecosystems if it is present in excess or in the wrong
    chemical form. If all organic material received by headwater streams and
    wetlands went directly downstream, the glut of decomposing material could
    deplete oxygen in downstream rivers, thereby damaging and even killing fish
    and other aquatic life. The ability of headwater streams to transform
    organic matter into more usable forms helps maintain healthy downstream
    ecosystems.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>
        HEADWATER STREAM SYSTEMS STORE AND TRANSFORM EXCESS ORGANIC MATTER
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Intact headwater systems both store and process organic matter in ways that
    modulate the release of carbon to downstream lakes and rivers. Headwater
    systems receive large amounts of organic matter, which can be retained and
    transformed into more palatable forms through decomposition processes. This
    organic matter is anything of biological origin that falls into, washes
    into or dies in a stream. Plant parts, such as leaves, twigs, stems and
    larger bits of woody debris, are the most common of these items. Another
    source of organic material is dead stream organisms, such as bits of dead
    algae and bacteria or bodies of insects and even larger animals. Waste
    products of plants and animals also add organic carbon to water. Water
    leaches dissolved organic carbon from organic materials in a stream and
    watershed like tea from a tea bag.
</p>
<p>
    Much of the organic matter that enters headwater systems remains there
    instead of continuing downstream. One reason is that the material often
    enters headwater streams as large pieces, such as leaves and woody debris,
    that are not easily carried downstream. In addition, debris dams that
    accumulate in headwater streams block the passage of materials. One study
    found four times more organic matter on the bottoms of headwater streams in
    forested watersheds than on the bottoms of larger streams. Another reason
    material stays in headwater streams is that food webs in small streams and
    wetlands process organic matter efficiently. Several studies have found
    that headwater streams are far more efficient at transforming organic
    matter than larger streams.
</p>
<p>
    For example, one study showed that, for a given length of stream, a
    headwater stream had an eight-fold higher processing efficiency than a
    fourth-order channel downstream. Microorganisms in headwater stream systems
    use material such as leaf litter and other decomposing material for food
    and, in turn, become food for other organisms. For example, fungi that grow
    on leaf litter become nutritious food for invertebrates that make their
    homes on the bottom of a stream, including mayflies, stoneflies and caddis
    flies. These animals provide food for larger animals, including birds such
    as flycatchers and fish such as trout.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>Headwater Systems Supply Food for Downstream Ecosystems</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The organic carbon released by headwater streams provides key food
    resources for downstream ecosystems. Headwater ecosystems control the form,
    quality and timing of carbon supply downstream. Although organic matter
    often enters headwaters in large amounts, such as when leaves fall in
    autumn or storm runoff carries debris into the stream, those leaves and
    debris are processed more slowly. As a result, carbon is supplied to
    downstream food webs more evenly over a longer period of time. Forms of
    carbon delivered range from dissolved organic carbon that feeds
    microorganisms to the drifting insects such as mayflies and midges that
    make ideal fish food. Such insects are the preferred food of fish such as
    trout, char and salmon. One study estimated that fishless headwater streams
    in Alaska export enough drifting insects and other invertebrates to support
    approximately half of the fish production in downstream waters.
</p>
<p>
    Processed organic matter from headwater streams fuels aquatic food webs
    from the smallest streams to the ocean. Only about half of all first-order
    streams drain into second-order streams; the other half feed directly into
    larger streams or directly into estuaries and oceans, thus delivering their
    carbon directly to these larger ecosystems. The health and productivity of
    downstream ecosystems depends on processed organic carbon—ranging from
    dissolved organic carbon to particles of fungus, and leaf litter to
    mayflies and stoneflies—delivered by upstream headwater systems.

        Why Does Phosphorus Cause Water Pollution Around the World?

                    If you look at a container of plant fertilizer, you will
                    see a “P,” which stands for “phosphorus,” an essential
                    nutrient in plant growth. Too much phosphorus in rivers and
                    lakes causes algae to bloom.Then, the lake or river is said
                    to be “eutrophic.” The condition is easy to identify.The
                    water becomes covered with a slimy green blanket of algae.
                    This increased plant growth increases the biological oxygen
                    demand in the water, and the system can “choke” from a lack
                    of oxygen. Dead fish then float on the water.
                    Eutrophication can cost millions of dollars through lost
                    fisheries and recreational opportunities. In Wisconsin, the
                    eutrophication of Lake Mendota has been estimated to cost
                    $50 million in lost recreation and devalued properties.

                    Phosphorus is a mineral that is found in rocks and soil. It
                    is cycled continuously around the planet. How, then, does a
                    river or lake get more phosphorus than it needs? Phosphorus
                    is mined and then concentrated in fertilizers and animal
                    feeds. Through rains and irrigation, the phosphorus runs
                    off agricultural fields or lawns into storm drains and into
                    rivers or lakes. This is called nonpoint source pollution.
                    Much has been done to control the point sources of
                    phosphorus from detergents and sewage. But nonpoint sources
                    are more difficult to control.

                    Water pollution is a problem around the world, as outlined
                    in the following article, “P Soup: The Global Phosphorus
                    Cycle.” The most recent data (1994) shows that
                    eutrophication is a problem in about 50% of lakes and
                    reservoirs in Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America. In
                    the Gulf of Mexico, there exists an extensive “dead zone”
                    in which nutrient run-off from agriculture has caused large
                    numbers of ocean species to die out.

    <strong>P Soup: The Global Phosphorus Cycle</strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    by Elena Bennett and Steve Carpenter
</p>
<p>
    Think of global environmental change, and you’ll probably think most
    immediately of such sweeping atmospheric phenomena as global warming or
    ozone depletion. Many of the other environmental disruptions we’re familiar
    with— toxic dumps, decimated forests, eroded fields—seem largely confined
    to particular localities.
</p>
<p>
    Yet there are some environmental changes that, while appearing to be
    locally confined,are in fact manifestations of worrisome global patterns.
    Look at the algae forming on a local farm pond, for example, and you’re
    seeing the result of a process—the phosphorus cycle—that extends far beyond
    that farm.
</p>
<p>
    Algae thrives (literally “blooms”) on runoff of waste fertilizer or other
    materials containing phosphorus. While human-caused changes in the closely
    related nitrogen cycle have been widely publicized, impacts on the
    phosphorus cycle are less well known. Our research suggests, however, that
    the movement of phosphorus is indeed a global phenomenon—and that that
    patch of algae you see in the pond at your feet may be affected by changes
    in the soil hundreds or thousands of miles away.
</p>
<p>
    Both nitrogen and phosphorus are essential nutrients for plants and are
    therefore present in most fertilizers in addition to being present in
    agricultural and municipal waste products. As a result, the movement of
    large amounts of fertilizers around the planet can also mean the movement
    of excessive nutrients from one place to another. Typically, some of the
    fertilizer used on a farm does not stay there but moves downhill where it
    can get into a downstream aquatic ecosystem—a river, lake, or bay.
    Concentrations of excess nutrients in these bodies of water cause the
    patches of algae to expand prolifically. Such “eutrophication,” as the
    green blanketing of the water is called, can be a crippling process: it
    suffocates the life under the slime— killing fish, diminishing
    biodiversity, and emitting noxious odors. It reduces the value of the water
    for most human uses— whether for drinking, fishing, swimming, or even
    boating.
</p>
<p>
    Lake Mendota, in Madison, Wisconsin is a classic example of a eutrophic
    lake in an urbanizing, but primarily agricultural setting. The lake has
    exhibited many of the symptoms associated with eutrophication since
    agriculture became the primary land cover in the surrounding watershed, in
    place of the native prairie and oak savannah. Blooms of blue-green algae
    have been common here since the 1880s. Along with these blooms came
    dramatic changes in the food web, including loss of some native species and
    increased populations of non-native species such as Eurasian milfoil and
    carp. Eutrophication has greatly diminished the lake’s recreational value.
</p>
<p>
    Historically, Madison has never developed public swimming pools, because
    people were always able to swim in the area’s plentiful lakes. Now, as
    eutrophication worsens, there is increasing public pressure to develop
    pools because many of the lakes are no longer swimmable. For Lake Mendota
    alone, the cost of eutrophication has been estimated to be about $50
    million in lost recreation and property values. Even so, what happened to
    this lake is seen as a local story—of little interest to someone in North
    Carolina or South China. If the people in Madison want to deal with this
    problem, obviously it is their own local farms and sewer pipes they have to
    deal with. What’s not so obvious is that what has happened here results
    from massive changes in the flow of phosphorus around the globe.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>HUMAN IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL PHOSPHORUS CYCLE</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Long before humans arrived on the scene, phosphorus was moving around the
    planet in a natural cycle that probably took millions of years to complete.
    A phosphorus molecule might be trapped in rock, then released by erosion to
    start its gravitydriven journey to the ocean. Along the way, it might be
    taken up by plants and then animals, then returned to the soil or water via
    dead vegetation or urine, to continue its slow trek downhill until it
    finally reached the ocean. Once in the ocean—probably after taking more
    detours through plants and animals along the way— it would sink into the
    sediment. In time, geological processes would turn this sediment to
    terrestrial rock—reincorporating the phosphorus molecule. The cycle would
    begin again.
</p>
<p>
    With the advent of human agriculture and urbanization, the natural cycle
    was in some respects shortcircuited. Technological advances, especially in
    the past 50 years, enabled us to mine phosphorus on a large scale, make
    fertilizer and other products from it, and transport these products around
    the world, dramatically accelerating the now not-so-natural phosphorus
    cycle. Globally, we estimate that the annual accumulation of phosphorus in
    the Earth’s freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems has almost quadrupled,
    from around 3.5 terragrams per year before humans began mining and farming
    on a large scale, to around 13 terragrams per year now.
</p>
<p>
    To understand the cycle as it was before human interventions began, it is
    useful to think of the cycle as a flow from the earth’s crust back to
    earth’s crust, through four main compartments. First, phosphorus-containing
    rock is weathered—worn by wind, rain, freezing and thawing, etc.—until it
    becomes soil. With the soil, it moves into lakes and rivers, which
    transport it to the ocean. Some of it is dissolved in water, and some
    adsorbed to soil particles that are carried by erosion down to the sea and,
    ultimately, to the ocean bottom. There it awaits the tectonic movement that
    will lift up the rock and make it part of the land again. The cycle is
described by Aldo Leopold in his essay, “Odyssey,” in    <em>A Sand County Almanac</em>: “X had marked time in the limestone ledge
    since the Paleozoic seas covered the land. Time, to an atom locked in a
    rock, does not pass. The break came when a bur-oak root nosed down a crack
    and began prying and sucking. In the flash of a century the rock decayed,
    and X was pulled out and up into the world of living things. He helped
    build a flower, which became an acorn, which fattened a deer, which fed an
    Indian, all in a single year. . . .” The narrative continues through a
    journey of many adventures involving a bluestem, a plover, some phlox, a
    fox, a buffalo, a spiderwort, a prairie fire, another fox, another Indian,
    a beaver, a bayou, and a riverbank. Then, “One spring an oxbow caved the
    bank and after one short week of freshet [a rise or overflow of a stream] X
    lay again in his ancient prison, the sea.”
</p>
<p>
    Within each of the four compartments of this cycle—the Earth’s crust, the
    soil, aquatic systems and the oceans—there are more rapid cycles of
    phosphorus through the biosphere. In the soil phase, the phosphorus does
    not all just stay put in the ground.

                    that acquired a notorious reputation over three
                    centuries—in making the nerve gas ethyl S-2
                    diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphrothiolate (VX); in the
                    organophosphate insecticides Tetraethyl diphosphate,
                    Parathion, and Malathion; in mortar and howitzer shells; in
                    the bombs Hitler rained on Britain; in the execution of
                    numerous murders; and—allegedly—in the infliction of Gulf
                    War Syndrome. But from the start, as suggested by Emsley’s
                    account of its discovery, the users of phosphorus had
                    little inkling of the damage its disruption might
                    ultimately do:

                    Uncertainty still surrounds the date on which phosphorus
                    was first made. We can be fairly sure the place was Hamburg
                    in Germany, and that the year was probably 1669, but the
                    month and day are not recorded, though it must have been
                    night time. The alchemist who made the discovery stumbled
                    upon a material the like of which had never been
                    seen.Unwittingly he unleashed upon an unsuspecting world
                    one of the most dangerous materials ever to have been made.

    Some of it is taken up from the soil by plants, which are eaten by animals,
    which may in turn be eaten by other animals, before the phosphorus is
    eventually returned to the soil in manure or through decomposition of the
    animals’ bodies after they die. Of course, the phosphorus molecule can go
    through several more of these rapid biospheric cycles before moving to the
    next compartment of the global cycle. Similar biospheric cycles may then
    take place in the ocean.

<p>
    People do several things that impact both the larger global cycle and the
    smaller, more rapid cycles of phosphorus through the biosphere. Most
    phosphorus mining takes place in only a few locations around the
    world—primarily in Florida, West and North Africa, and Russia. Mined
    phosphorus is then made into fertilizers, animal feeds, and other

                    stone.Like many before him he had been investigating the
                    golden stream, urine, and he was heating the residues from
                    this which he had boiled down to a dry solid. He stoked his
                    small furnace with more charcoal and pumped the bellows
                    until his retort glowed red hot. Suddenly something strange
                    began to happen. Glowing fumes filled the vessel and from
                    the end of the retort dripped a shining liquid that burst
                    into flames. . . .

                    man who insisted on being called <em>Herr Doktor </em>
                    Brandt. His first thought was that he had at last found
                    what he had been searching for. Surely this wondrous new
                    material was the philosopher’s stone? If so, he had better
                    keep the secret to himself while he made his fortune. And
                    so for six long years he hid his discovery from the world,
                    until his wealth was all but spent. Magical though it was,

    products and transported to agricultural areas all over the world. There
    they are incorporated into the soil, either directly as fertilizers or
    indirectly as excess phosphorus in manure resulting from the use of
    high-phosphate animal feeds. Poor land-use practices further increase
    erosion of this phosphorus-laden soil.
</p>
<p>
    Human actions thus accelerate the natural cycle at two key points: in the
    entry of phosphorus into the biosphere from rock, and in the movement from
    soil into aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, by moving phosphorus away from
    certain spots on the Earth’s surface (those where it is mined) and to
    others (primarily where it is used as fertilizer and animal feed), we
    radically alter the distribution of this element on the planet’s surface.
    The effect of shifting large quantities to places where it would not
    naturally be found in high concentration has become a growing concern to
    aquatic ecologists and others who care about maintaining supplies of clean
    fresh water.
</p>
<p>
    Most phosphorus moves downhill attached to eroded soil particles—whether
    over the ground as muddy runoff or in rain-swollen streams or rivers. As
    people increase the amount of phosphorus in the soil through use of
    fertilizers, the amount of phosphorus carried downhill per kilogram of soil
    also increases. The higher the concentration in the soil at the outset, the
    more is available to release downhill. And although it is likely that less
    than 5 percent of the phosphorus used as fertilizer in temperate areas
    makes its way into aquatic ecosystems each year, that is enough to cause
    major changes in those environments.
</p>
<p>
    Understanding what is happening in the upland soil provides a window on the
    future of downhill water bodies. If we study soil uphill from lakes and
    rivers, we know more about the possibilities for the future of those same
    lakes, rivers, and the estuaries they flow into. Studying changes in the
    phosphorus cycle and upland soils on a global scale can help us know where
    to expect problems in the future and may help us reduce excess phosphorus
    before it is a problem.

<p align="left">
    <strong>MESSING WITH EUTROPHICATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Under natural conditions, eutrophication can be a centuries-long aging
    process for some lakes. When human caused (scientists call this “cultural”
    eutrophication), it can happen in a few years. In many cases, cultural
    eutrophication can be reversed by greatly reducing the amount of phosphorus
    entering the water.
</p>
<p>
    Phosphorus is just one of many nutrients that plants need to survive and
    grow. However, it is particularly important to lake systems because it is
    the limiting nutrient. In other words, even when plants have all other
    nutrients in sufficient quantities, they will often lack phosphorus. When
    phosphorus is added to lake water, plants may suddenly grow very rapidly
    because all the necessary nutrients are now present. But the excessive
    growth of one organism may mean the death of another. When thick blooms of
    algal growth block sunlight from reaching the plants below, the decay of
    dead algae uses up the available oxygen in the water, suffocating fish and
    sometimes causing whole populations of species to be lost. Eutrophication
    not only makes a lake look and smell putrid; it also substantially changes
    the way the aquatic ecosystem works. It can change the plant community, the
    food web, and the chemistry of a lake beyond recognition.
</p>
<p>
    Although scientists have been studying eutrophication since the turn of the
    twentieth century, cultural eutrophication was not recognized as a
    widespread international problem until the 1950s and ’60s, when it became a
    matter of growing concern in both North America’s Great Lakes region and in
    much of Europe. “Lakes became green and smelly, devoid of fish, unfit as
    sources of drinking water and unimaginable as places of recreation,” writes
    John Emsley in
    <em>
        The Thirteenth Element: A Sordid Tale of Murder, Fire, and Phosphorus
    </em>
    . Scientists did not always know that phosphorus was the culprit in
    situations of cultural eutrophication. But in the late 1960s, a research
    team headed by David Schindler, a professor of Ecology at the University of
    Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, conducted a revealing experiment on a
    lake—known as “Lake 227”—in northwestern Ontario. The team divided the lake
    into two halves. They enriched one half with nitrogen and carbon, and the
    other half with phosphorus and carbon. The phosphate-enriched basin rapidly
    became eutrophic, while the other basin remained unchanged.
</p>
<p>
    Phosphorus became widely recognized as the source of fresh water
    eutrophication problems, and efforts were begun to reduce phosphorus inputs
    to aquatic ecosystems. In most of the developed world, sewage was diverted
    around lakes, and most “point” sources (direct outflows of phosphorus-rich
    effluents from specific farms or processing plants) were cut off.
</p>
<p>
    By the 1990s, phosphates had been removed from most detergents, as well.Yet
    eutrophication persisted, in part because lakes are efficient recyclers of
    phosphorus. Under conditions of low oxygen at the lake bottom, phosphorus
    lying in the sediment reenters the water column and is once again available
    to be used by algae. The problem also remained because scientists had
    overlooked another source of phosphorus entering lakes— the non-point
    source runoff from surrounding lands—which proves much more difficult to
    control. Currently, non-point runoff from uplands is the main source of
    phosphorus to most aquatic systems in the developed world.
</p>
<p>
    Worldwide, eutrophication in lakes, rivers, and estuaries appears to be
    increasing. In the Gulf of Mexico, there is now a large hypoxic zone, or
    “dead” zone, where the low oxygen content of the water has led to massive
    die-offs in ocean species. The cause has been traced to nutrient runoff
    from the grain-growing states of the midwestern United States, carried to
    the Gulf by the Mississippi River. In New Zealand, an increase in dairy
    farming and fertilizer use has worsened nutrient pollution in hundreds of
    shallow lakes and streams. By 1994, the most recent date for which we have
    worldwide data, significant eutrophication problems were being reported in
    54 percent of all lakes and reservoirs in Southeast Asia, 53 percent of
    those in Europe, 48 percent in North America, 41 percent in South America,
    and 28 percent in Africa.
</p>
<p>
    The growing recognition that eutrophication is more widespread than we
    might have initially imagined led us to look for a larger-scale perspective
    on the issue and its causes. We knew that the immediate cause is human
    impact on phosphorus cycling: increased phosphorus in soils and increase
    erosion causes increased erosion to lakes. However, we wanted to understand
    the eutrophication problem from a global perspective because we believed
    that this perspective might lead to more effective long-term policies to
    reduce phosphorus load to aquatic ecosystems. Studying phosphorus increase
    in soils, as opposed to waiting until fish begin dying off in lakes, can be
    an effective preventive measure. So far, the systematic assessment of
    phosphorus in upland soils has not become a standard of the eutrophication
    management process.

    <strong>MANAGEMENT: THE GLOBAL PICTURE</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Despite widespread controlling of point source pollution, treatment of
    sewage, and elimination of phosphates from most soaps and detergents,
    eutrophication continues to worsen as a result of human activity worldwide.
    What to do?
</p>
<p>
    The phosphorus in agricultural soils could take decades to draw down by
    reducing use of fertilizers. During that time, changes in farm practices,
    urban expansion, or climate change could accelerate erosion and—despite the
    lower input of phosphorus to soil—increase the rate at which phosphorus
    moves from the soil into aquatic ecosystems. By the time authorities see
    enough impairment of lakes to want to take action upstream, the fate of the
    lakes downstream may already have been sealed. By the same logic, however,
    the long time lags associated with soil phosphorus buildup also mean that
    action now can prevent expensive and persistent eutrophication problems in
    the future.
</p>
<p>
    Efforts to control phosphorus runoff have increased dramatically in recent
    years. Still, most policies and regulations have approached such runoff as
    a problem of the particular lake, river reach, or estuary, rather than as
    part of a larger pattern. These efforts have generally involved reducing
    nearby fertilizer and manure use, limiting erosion, or removing algae from
    the water directly. In Lake Mendota, the city regularly runs a floating
    lawn mower–like machine that strips algae and other aquatic plants from the
    water.
</p>
<p>
    To implement the long-term solution by reducing the phosphorus stored in
    upland soil is more difficult. Because upland runoff originates from more
    dispersed sources, it is very difficult to pinpoint the landowners who are
    responsible. One consequence is that in the United States, programs are
    usually voluntary rather than mandatory. Effectiveness is limited,

                    0.1 percent of the Earth’s crust is phosphorus), it is an
                    essential nutrient for all life forms on our planet. It is
                    found primarily in solid or liquid state and it plays a key

                    Phosphorus is mined in only a few countries, including the
                    United States, the former Soviet Union, Morocco, and China;
                    however, phosphorus-containing products are consumed in
                    most countries. About 90 percent of the phosphorus mined
                    annually is used to produce fertilizers and animal feeds.

                    Globally, we knew that by mining phosphorus in order to put
                    it on farms and lawns, we were likely to be creating new
                    areas of high concentration. However, scientists knew
                    little about where accumulation might be most severe.
                    Answering this question would help managers prepare for
                    future eutrophication problems.

                    We made a budget (analogous to a household’s financial
                    budget) to find out how much phosphorus is accumulating in
                    the soil compartment of the global model each year. We
                    wanted to get a largescale picture because we thought we
                    might have more options for management if eutrophication
                    was recognized as a global, rather than just local,

    especially if the incentives for participation are not great enough. In
    some cases, local water authorities attempt to help farmers (and others) to
    limit phosphorus use or reduce erosion by offering cost sharing from the

    may offer to pay a share of the cost of creating a manure storage pit.

                    amount of naturally weathered phosphorus. These are the
                    inputs to Earth’s soil. We also calculated how much was
                    leaving Earth’s soils each year, by estimating how much
                    phosphorus moved into the ocean and other aquatic
                    ecosystems. The difference between the inputs and the
                    outputs is the amount that accumulates in soils on an
                    annual basis, which we estimated to be between 10.5 and

                    We completed a similar calculation for soil accumulation of
                    phosphorus before widespread human impact. In the millennia
                    before civilization began, of course, there was no mining
                    of phosphorus—only natural weathering, which released
                    between 1 and 6 million metric tons per year.

                    By making separate calculations for agricultural areas and
                    nonagricultural, we found that although agricultural areas
                    occupy only a small fraction of the Earth’s surface (about
                    11 percent), most of the phosphorus accumulation occurs
                    there.Year by year, phosphorus continues to build up in the

                    Separating calculations for poor and rich countries, we
                    found that while poor countries once had a net loss of
                    phosphorus, they now account for more accumulation than
                    rich countries do. Lakes in these countries are probably
                    becoming more susceptible to eutrophication, which is

    than enacted voluntarily. Eutrophication is a major concern for the
    Netherlands, due to the country’s high population density and intensive
    agriculture—combined with the fact that the Rhine River water that flows
    into the Netherlands from other European countries is already high in
    phosphorus content. Therefore, Dutch farmers are subject to manure quotas:
    for each acre of land, they may only spread a certain amount of manure.
    (The amount allowed per acre often depends on the location, size, and type
    of farm.) For any manure used beyond that amount, the farmer must pay the
    costs of removal and processing.
</p>
<p>
    As we begin to look at eutrophication as a global phenomenon, we notice
    that around the world, water subsidizes agricultural systems. Because we do
    not account for the cost of water pollution when we add up the cost of
    agricultural production, food production seems cheaper than it actually is.
    In economic terms, the cost of water pollution caused by agricultural
    production is an externality to the agricultural production system. If this
    worked in the past because clean fresh water seemed infinite, it no longer
    makes sense to take fresh water supply for granted. Since both food and
    water are necessary for human survival, it might appear that we are facing
    a difficult choice between producing food and protecting aquatic resources.
    However, just as we cannot afford to ignore water pollution, we cannot
    afford to solve the problem simply by reducing agricultural production.
</p>
<p>
    The growing human population and increasing demand for food, along with the
    lack of vacant arable land for use in agricultural expansion, mean that
    agricultural production will probably have to become more intense and
    efficient on land already in production.
</p>
<p>
    Win-win solutions would change regulations and incentives to bring the
    costs and benefits of agricultural production and water quality protection
    into better balance.For example,governments could create markets for
    nitrogen and phosphorus runoff.
</p>
<p>
    Each farm would be allotted a certain amount of permissible pollution or
    runoff. If the farmer could find a way to emit less pollution, he could
    then sell some of his pollution rights to another farm. If set up
    correctly, the market would quickly adjust to the value of water—thereby
    internalizing the cost of water pollution.
</p>
<p>
    Alternatively, governments could tax fertilizer use to create an incentive
    for conservation, using the tax revenues to improve water quality.
</p>
<p>
    Such methods can prove economically as well as environmentally beneficial.
    A few years ago, New York City, which gets its water supply from the
    Catskill mountain area, found that its water was no longer meeting EPA
    [Environmental Protection Agency] standards due to fertilizers and
    pesticides in the soil. City officials realized they would have to spend
    between $6 billion and $8 billion to build a water filtration plant to
    clean the water. Instead, they were able to purchase watershed land in the
    Catskills sufficient to naturally filter the water for only $1.5 billion.
    Quality of the water supply was increased and money was saved.
</p>
<p>
    Comparable solutions may be feasible at national and global scales, making
    it possible to conserve fertilizer, stabilize soils, and improve water
    quality while reducing costs. Effective policies might include the
    establishment of national or international phosphorus markets and better
    tracking of phosphorus around the world, in order to ensure that some areas
    are not being overwhelmed by excess nutrients. Phosphorus markets could
    ensure that products such as manure are moved to where they can be used.

        thick mat of oxygen-gobbling algae.

        To Phil Norton, recently retired manager of the six Klamath Basin
        national wildlife refuges on the Oregon-California border, this vista
        at Tule Lake refuge is an all-too-familiar sign of an ecosystem being
        slowly destroyed by lack of fresh water.More than 60 farmers who lease
        20,500 acres [8,296 hectares] on the refuge (compared with 14,000 acres
        [5,666 hectares] devoted to wetlands habitat) siphon off much of this
        precious resource, thanks to a 1964 law that they say gives them rights
        to the cropland.
    </p>
    <p>
        To replenish refuge ponds and vary their levels at different times of
        year—necessary to maintain appropriate wildlife habitat—Tule Lake’s
        staff needs large, regular inflows of fresh water. Yet the refuges get
        only what little water is left after the federal Bureau of Reclamation
        supplies farmers and other competing users. Even in wet years, the
        Klamath refuges do not get as much water as they need. And during times
        of drought, battles over this critical resource turn ugly, with the
        protected areas generally coming out the losers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water is the lifeblood of the National Wildlife Refuge System, and
        inadequate water quantity and quality are among the biggest threats to
        refuges nationwide. “On the vast majority of our national wildlife
        refuges, water is the critical issue,” says the system’s deputy chief,
        Jim Kurth. “It is the resource that limits our ability to provide
        first-class fish and wildlife habitat.” Short water supply is the most
        pervasive problem, with managers from at least 150 refuges reporting
        conflicts with competing users. Other challenges include flows tainted
        by pesticides, fertilizers, animal waste and other pollutants; huge
        navigation and flood control projects that alter refuge water sources;
        inundation of saltwater marshes by rising seas; and wetlands draining
        by private land owners. Such problems are only expected to worsen in
        the future, adds Kurth, “as population grows, and there is increasing
        demand for water from urban areas, agriculture and industry.”
    </p>
    <p>
        At Tule Lake, the effects of water shortages are obvious. Instead of
        seasonal wetlands, deep pools, wading shallows and vegetation-rich
        islands, there are muck-bottomed ponds containing fertilizer and other
        agricultural chemicals where a few endangered sucker fish struggle to
        survive. The water’s surface is covered by a carpet of algae thick
        enough in places for waterfowl to walk on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The impact on wildlife has been predictably dramatic. Strategically
        located on the Pacific Flyway, Klamath’s wetlands historically served
        as a critical stopover for 80 percent of North American migratory
        waterfowl that travel this western route. A half century ago, some 6
        million ducks, geese and swans would shade out the sun twice a year as
        they migrated between their northern breeding grounds and southern
        wintering habitat. But today those epochal wildlife spectacles are a
        distant memory, and the migration is down to about 1.5 million birds.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The importance of the Klamath Basin to the Pacific Flyway cannot be
        overstated,” says NWF [National Wildlife Federation] attorney Jan
        Hasselman, who before joining the federation in 2001 represented both
        conservation groups and commercial fishermen in court battles over the
        region’s water. “Until we have a fair plan to allocate the Klamath
        Basin’s scarce water over the long term, these crown jewels of our
        wildlife refuge system will continue to deteriorate.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Today’s troubles on the refuges have been more than 100 years in the
        making. At the turn of the century, the Klamath Basin was covered by
        some 190,000 acres [76,890 hectares] of shallow wetlands, an area
        larger than Lake Tahoe. The Klamath River and its tributaries were
        among the richest salmon and steelhead trout habitats in the West, and
        lakes teemed with freshwater mullet (also called sucker fish). But in
        1902, the newly formed Bureau of Reclamation began to build dams,
        reservoirs and pipelines, diverting water from the river system and
        draining 80 percent of its wetlands to uncover rich peat soils for
        farming. Both Tule Lake and Lower Klamath refuges also were created
        during this period, but because of the federal government’s
        interpretation of refuge water rights—an interpretation
        conservationists reject—the sanctuaries have been on virtual life
        support ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2001, decades of competition for the basin’s scarce water reached an
        acrimonious climax when a drought left reservoirs so low that the
        Bureau of Reclamation, acting under court order, cut off two-thirds of
        the water routinely delivered to farmers and sent it instead into lakes
        and rivers harboring endangered salmon and mullet. Waterfowl habitat on
        the refuges, meanwhile, did not receive much more than a tea cup. Two
        years later, water users remain locked in a two-sided battle—with
        conservationists, Indian tribes and commercial fishermen advocating
        that more water be left in the river system and its wetlands, and
        farmers trying to take more out. Last fall, NWF entered the fray when
        it joined a coalition of ten conservation groups that have filed a
        lawsuit challenging the government’s policy of favoring farmers over
        wildlife on the Klamath refuges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elsewhere, water woes vary from refuge to refuge, yet they are common
        in nearly every region of the country. Some of the biggest threats come
        from mega-projects sponsored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
        Stretching for 261 riverine miles [420 km] through Illinois, Iowa,
        Wisconsin and Minnesota, the Upper Mississippi River Wildlife and Fish
        Refuge provides a typical example. A Corps proposal to expand six locks
        on the Mississippi downstream from the refuge threatens the fecund
        ecosystems of its mainstream river, floodplain and wetlands—critical
        migratory bird stopovers on the Mississippi Flyway. The refuge harbors
        some 300 avian species, including 40 percent of the continent’s
        waterfowl population, as well as 100 species of fish and 40 species of
        freshwater mussels.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Upper Mississippi refuge biologist Eric Nelson, bigger
        locks would encourage more barge traffic and require increased channel
        maintenance, exacerbating adverse effects of navigation already being
        felt on the refuge.“We fear more erosion and siltation, which will mean
        the loss of island habitat crucial to protecting backwaters from wind
        and wave action,’’ says Nelson.
    </p>
    <p>
        “This will affect everything from migrating waterfowl to fisheries.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Another Corps project to facilitate barge traffic—this one to help
        farmers get grain to market faster in Arkansas— portends major problems
        for the state’s White River and Cache River refuges. Together, these
        refuges protect more than 200,000 acres [80,937 hectares] of bottomland
        hardwood forest and support North America’s largest population of
        wintering mallards, along with bald eagles, least terns and Arkansas’
        most important black bear population. The Corps plans to dredge or dike
        nearly 100 miles [161 km] running through the White River preserve,
        which would increase siltation and erosion as well as damage rare and
        sensitive forested wetlands on both refuges.“It’s like building a
        four-lane highway just to deliver the mail,” complains White River
        refuge manager Larry Mallard. Both refuges also are threatened by a
        number of irrigation projects, most notably the Grand Prairie
        Demonstration Project, which would siphon off more than a billion
        gallons of water a day.
    </p>
    <p>
        On scores of other refuges, water pollution is the biggest problem,
        sometimes killing vast numbers of fish and birds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Located on the state’s largest inland body of water, California’s Sonny
        Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge is perhaps the most dramatic
        example. Each day, the sea absorbs roughly the equivalent of a
        one-mile-long trainload of contaminants, including pesticides, mineral
        salts and fertilizers such as nitrogen and phosphorus. From the north,
        the effluent seeps down as agricultural runoff from farming operations
        in the Imperial Valley. From the south, the New River, reputedly the
        filthiest waterway in the United States, flows out of Mexico and dumps
        industrial effluent, raw sewage, slaughterhouse wastes and other toxins
        into this contaminated crucible. And because the sea is a sump with no
        outlets, expanding and contracting with cycles of inflowing water and
        evaporation, concentrations of pollutants only increase over time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The effects on refuge wildlife have been disastrous. So many birds die
        after eating fish poisoned in the sea’s chemical soup that the refuge
        operates two incinerators to dispose of their carcasses, as well as the
        thousands of fish that routinely float bellyup in the stagnant water.
        In the summer of 1996, one outbreak of avian botulism alone killed over
        8,500 white pelicans and more than 1,125 endangered brown pelicans.
    </p>
    <p>
        At South Carolina’s Cape Romaine National Wildlife Refuge, the primary
        water contaminant is shrimp bait. Between 1988 and 1997, the number of
        shrimpers using the refuge rose from about 100 to a staggering 20,000,
        all of them baiting with unsterilized fish meal mixed with clay or
        cement, a combination that causes high nutrient levels lethal to
        aquatic life. A massive die-off of oysters in the refuge, for example,
        has triggered a sharp decline in its American oystercatcher population.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the water news on refuges is not all bad. Deputy Chief Kurth points
        to an encouraging trend toward buying private land in areas prone to
        flooding and creating new wildlife sanctuaries there. As an example, he
        points to the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge in Missouri,
        which was established in 1994 along Missouri River bottomland that
        shelters a variety of resident and migratory birds, as well as
        endangered species such as piping plover, pallid sturgeon and gray bat.
        “With flooding and channel restoration, we’re letting the river behave
        like a river,” says Kurth.
    </p>
    <p>
        On some refuges, even the Corps of Engineers is playing the hero. In
        Arizona, for example, the Bill Williams River National Wildlife Refuge
        boasts one of the biggest and most diverse stretches of riparian
        habitat on the Lower Colorado River system. A haven for desert bighorn
        sheep, mule deer, javelina and mountain lions, along with more than 335
        species of birds, 34 butterflies and 15 bats, this critical wildlife
        habitat is at the mercy of Corps officials who operate a dam 40 miles
        [64 km] upstream. Yet so far, the Corps has provided refuge manager
        Dick Gilbert enough water to maintain his sanctuary’s diversity.
        “They’re excellent neighbors,’’ Gilbert says.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the threatened Upper Mississippi refuge, the Corps is participating
        in a major habitat restoration project—even as it proceeds with its
        controversial lock-and-dam expansion proposal downstream. Created in
        1924, the refuge’s riverine habitats were drastically altered a decade
        later when the Corps constructed its initial series of dams and locks,
        converting a free-flowing river into a series of giant pools between
        the dams. The changes led to loss of emergent vegetation, which in turn
        reduced numbers of puddle ducks such as mallards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two years ago, refuge managers—working both with the Corps and other
        federal and state agencies—experimented at one of these artificial
        lakes in Wisconsin, using the lock-anddam system to lower water levels
        by 18 inches [46 cm] during the summer. The benefits to wildlife were
        swift and dramatic. New areas of dry land quickly sprouted vegetation,
        and more light penetrating shallow waters increased aquatic plants,
        improving habitat for both waterfowl and fish. The project turned out
        to be “a wonderful, innovative way to get enhanced wildlife habitat on
        the river,” says refuge biologist Eric Nelson. “We’re going to have a
        diversity of species we have not seen here in decades.”

        <strong>What Are the Threats to Groundwater?</strong>

                        Groundwater makes up about 97% of the available (not
                        frozen) freshwater on the planet. But you can’t fish in
                        it, you can’t swim in it, and you can’t wade in it to
                        cool off. For this reason, groundwater is often
                        forgotten. Groundwater is the water that lies between
                        the soil or rock particles under the Earth’s surface.
                        It doesn’t flow in underground rivers, but there can be
                        large deposits of it, called aquifers. But before you
                        assume that there are endless supplies of groundwater
                        on the planet, consider that the available freshwater
                        makes up only about 1% of all the Earth’s water.The
                        rest is in the oceans (97%) or is frozen (the 2% in
                        glaciers).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides its location, there are several things that
                        make groundwater different from surface water.
                        Obviously, we cannot see it. So, unlike lakes that get
                        scummy or rivers that turn white with pollution, we may
                        not know for many years when groundwater becomes
                        polluted. Secondly, it moves much differently from
                        surface water. Groundwater movement depends on the lay
                        of the land and the type of soil or rock it is in.Thus,
                        pollutants can move slowly, quickly, or quite
                        unpredictably. Thirdly, groundwater lacks the flushing,
                        or cleaning, action of surface water.Therefore,
                        contaminants can remain underground and undetected for
                        many years. Lastly, groundwater recharges (refills)
                        much more slowly than surface water does. This means
                        that once the supply is depleted, it could take
                        hundreds or even thousands of years for water to refill
                        the spaces in the soil. Groundwater may be out of
                        sight, but it cannot be kept out of mind if we want to
                        have a continued supply of clean drinking and
                        irrigation water.

                    <p>
                        The following World Watch Institute Paper, “Groundwater
                        Shock,” examines groundwater issues from all over the
                        world. World Watch Institute is an independent,
                        nonprofit environmental research organization based in
                        Washington, D.C. World Watch papers give in-depth
                        analysis of issues and are reviewed by experts in the
                        field.Their reports are published in five languages. In
                        this report, author Payla Sampat easily builds the case
                        that threats to groundwater are numerous and serious.
                        Pollution is a huge threat: pollution from landfills,
                        from dumpsites, from

        agriculture, and from industries. Too much water being pumped from
        groundwater is another threat. In some places—California and Florida,
        for example—the land literally sinks, or subsides, when too much
        groundwater is pumped out. The challenge is for governments and
        citizens to protect the valuable groundwater resources before they are
        irretrievably degraded. Sampat aptly ends his article with a quote from
        Henry David Thoreau: “Heaven is under our feet, as well as over our
        heads.”

    <p>
        The Mississippi River occupies a mythic place in the American
        imagination, in part because it is so huge. At any given moment, on
        average,about 2,100 billion liters of water are flowing across the Big
        Muddy’s broad bottom.If you were to dive about 35 feet down and lie on
        that bottom, you might feel a sense of awe that the whole river was on
        top of you. But in one very important sense, you’d be completely
        wrong.At any point in time,only 1 percent of the water in the
        Mississippi River system is in the part of the river that flows
        downstream to the Gulf of Mexico.The other 99 percent lies beneath the
        bottom,locked in massive strata of rock and sand.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a distinction of enormous consequence. The availability of
        clean water has come to be recognized as perhaps the most critical of
        all human security issues facing the world in the next
        quarter-century—and what is happening to water buried under the bottoms
        of rivers, or under our feet, is vastly different from what happens to
        the “surface” water of rivers, lakes, and streams. New research finds
        that contrary to popular belief, it is groundwater that is most
        dangerously threatened. Moreover, the Mississippi is not unique in its
        ratio of surface to underground water; worldwide, 97 percent of the
        planet’s liquid freshwater is stored in aquifers.
    </p>
</div>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    In the early centuries of civilization, surface water was the only source
    we needed to know about. Human population was less than a tenth of one
    percent the size it is now; settlements were on river banks; and the water
    was relatively clean. We still think of surface water as being the main
    resource. So it’s easy to think that the problem of contamination is mainly
    one of surface water: it is polluted rivers and streams that threaten
    health in times of flood, and that have made waterborne diseases a major
    killer of humankind. But in the past century, as population has almost
    quadrupled and rivers have become more depleted and polluted, our
    dependence on pumping groundwater has soared—and as it has, we’ve made a
    terrible discovery. Contrary to the popular impression that at least the
    waters from our springs and wells are pure, we’re uncovering a pattern of
    pervasive pollution there too. And in these sources, unlike rivers, the
    pollution is generally irreversible.
</p>
<p>
    This is largely the work of another hidden factor: the rate of groundwater
    renewal is very slow in comparison with that of surface water. It’s true
    that some aquifers recharge fairly quickly, but the average recycling time
    for groundwater is 1,400 years, as opposed to only 20 days for river water.
    So when we pump out groundwater, we’re effectively removing it from
    aquifers for generations to come. It may evaporate and return to the
    atmosphere quickly enough, but the resulting rainfall (most of which falls
    back into the oceans) may take centuries to recharge the aquifers once
    they’ve been depleted. And because water in aquifers moves through the
    Earth with glacial slowness, its pollutants continue to accumulate.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike rivers, which flush themselves into the oceans, aquifers become
    sinks for pollutants, decade after decade—thus further diminishing the
    amount of clean water they can yield for human use.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps the largest misconception being exploded by the spreading water
    crisis is the assumption that the ground we stand on—and what lies beneath
    it—is solid, unchanging, and inert. Just as the advent of climate change
    has awakened us to the fact that the air over our heads is an arena of
    enormous forces in the midst of titanic shifts, the water crisis has
    revealed that, slow-moving though it may be, groundwater is part of a
    system of powerful hydrological interactions—between earth, surface water,
    sky, and sea—that we ignore at our peril. A few years ago, reflecting on
    how human activity is beginning to affect climate, Columbia University
    scientist Wallace Broecker warned, “The climate system is an angry beast
    and we are poking it with sticks.” A similar statement might now be made
    about the system under our feet. If we continue to drill holes into
    it—expecting it to swallow our waste and yield freshwater in return—we may
    be toying with an outcome no one could wish.

    For most of human history, groundwater was tapped mainly in arid regions
    where surface water was in short supply. From Egypt to Iran, ancient Middle
    Eastern civilizations used periscope-like conduits to funnel spring water
    from mountain slopes to nearby towns—a technology that allowed settlement
    to spread out from the major rivers. Over the centuries, as populations and
    cropland expanded, innovative well-digging techniques evolved in China,
    India, and Europe. Water became such a valuable resource that some cultures
    developed elaborate mythologies imbuing underground water and its seekers
    with special powers. In medieval Europe, people called water witches or
    dowsers were believed to be able to detect groundwater using a forked stick
    and mystical insight.
</p>
<p>
    In the second half of the 20<sup>th </sup>century, the soaring demand for
    water turned the dowsers’ modernday counterparts into a major industry.
    Today, major aquifers are tapped on every continent, and groundwater is the
    primary source of drinking water for more than 1.5 billion people
    worldwide. The aquifer that lies beneath the Huang-Huai-Hai plain in
    eastern China alone supplies drinking water to nearly 160 million people.
    Asia as a whole relies on its groundwater for nearly one-third of its
    drinking water supply. Some of the largest cities in the developing
    world—Jakarta, Dhaka, Lima, and Mexico City, among them—depend on aquifers
    for almost all their water. And in rural areas, where centralized water
    supply systems are undeveloped, groundwater is typically the sole source of
    water.
</p>
<p>
    More than 95 percent of the rural U.S. population depends on groundwater
    for drinking. A principal reason for the explosive rise in groundwater use
    since 1950 has been a dramatic expansion in irrigated agriculture. In
    India, the leading country in total irrigated area and the world’s third
    largest grain producer, the number of shallow tubewells used to draw
    groundwater surged from 3,000 in 1960 to 6 million in 1990. While India
    doubled the amount of its land irrigated by surface water between 1950 and
    1985, it increased the area watered by aquifers 113-fold. Today, aquifers
    supply water to more than half of India’s irrigated land. The United
    States, with the third highest irrigated area in the world, uses
    groundwater for 43 percent of its irrigated farmland.
</p>
<p>
    Worldwide, irrigation is by far the biggest drain on freshwater: it
    accounts for about 70 percent of the water we draw from rivers and wells
    each year.
</p>
<p>
    Other industries have been expanding their water use even faster than
    agriculture—and generating much higher profits in the process. On average,
    a ton of water used in industry generates roughly $14,000 worth of
    output—about 70 times as much profit as the same amount of water used to
    grow grain. Thus, as the world has industrialized, substantial amounts of
    water have been shifted from farms to more lucrative factories. Industry’s
    share of total consumption has reached 19 percent and is likely to continue
    rising rapidly. The amount of water available for drinking is thus
    constrained not only by a limited resource base, but by competition with
    other, more powerful users.
</p>
<p>
    And as rivers and lakes are stretched to their limits—many of them dammed,
    dried up, or polluted—we’re growing more and more dependent on groundwater
    for all these uses. In Taiwan, for example, the share of water supplied by
    groundwater almost doubled from 21 percent in 1983 to over 40 percent in
    1991. And Bangladesh, which was once almost entirely river- and
    stream-dependent, dug over a million wells in the 1970s to substitute for
    its badly polluted surfacewater supply. Today, almost 90 percent of its
    people use only groundwater for drinking.
</p>
<p>
    Even as our dependence on groundwater increases, the availability of the
    resource is becoming more limited. On almost every continent, many major
    aquifers are being drained faster than their natural rate of recharge.
    Groundwater depletion is most severe in parts of India, China, the United
    States, North Africa, and the Middle East. Under certain geological
    conditions, groundwater overdraft can cause aquifer sediments to compact,
    permanently shrinking the aquifer’s storage capacity. This loss can be
    quite considerable, and irreversible. The amount of water storage capacity
    lost because of aquifer compaction in California’s Central Valley, for
    example, is equal to more than 40 percent of the combined storage capacity
    of all humanmade reservoirs across the state.
</p>
<p>
    As the competition among factories, farms, and households intensifies, it’s
    easy to overlook the extent to which freshwater is also required for
    essential ecological services. It is not just rainfall, but groundwater
    welling up from beneath, that replenishes rivers, lakes, and streams. In a
    study of 54 streams in different parts of the country, the U.S. Geological
    Survey (USGS) found that groundwater is the source for more than half the
    flow, on average. The 492 billion gallons (1.86 cubic kilometers) of water
    aquifers add to U.S. surface water bodies each day is nearly equal to the
    daily flow of the Mississippi. Groundwater provides the base contribution
    for the Mississippi, the Niger, the Yangtze, and many more of the world’s
    great rivers—some of which would otherwise not be flowing year-round.
    Wetlands, important habitat for birds, fish, and other wildlife, are often
    largely groundwaterfed, created in places where the water table overflows
    to the surface on a constant basis. And while providing surface bodies with
    enough water to keep them stable, aquifers also help prevent them from
    flooding: when it rains heavily, aquifers beneath rivers soak up the excess
    water, preventing the surface flow from rising too rapidly and overflowing
    onto neighboring fields and towns. In tropical Asia, where the hot season
    can last as long as 9 months, and where monsoon rains can be very intense,
    this dual hydrological service is of critical value.
</p>
<p>
    Numerous studies have tracked the extent to which our increasing demand on
    water has made it a resource critical to a degree that even gold and oil
    have never been. It’s the most valuable thing on Earth. Yet, ironically,
    it’s the thing most consistently overlooked, and most widely used as a
    final resting place for our waste. And, of course, as contamination
    spreads, the supplies of usable water get tighter still.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>TRACKING THE HIDDEN CRISIS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In 1940, during the Second World War, the U.S. Department of the Army
    acquired 70 square kilometers [27 square miles] of land around Weldon
    Spring and its neighboring towns near St. Louis, Missouri. Where farmhouses
    and barns had been, the Army established the world’s largest TNT-producing
    facility. In this sprawling warren of plants, toluene (a component of
    gasoline) was treated with nitric acid to produce more than a million tons
    of the explosive compound each day when production was at its peak.
</p>
<p>
    Part of the manufacturing process involved purifying the TNT—washing off
    unwanted “nitroaromatic” compounds left behind by the chemical reaction
    between the toluene and nitric acid. Over the years, millions of gallons of
    this red-colored muck were generated. Some of it was treated at wastewater
    plants, but much of it ran off from the leaky treatment facilities into
    ditches and ravines, and soaked into the ground. In 1945, when the Army
    left the site, soldiers burned down the contaminated buildings but left the
    red-tinged soil and the rest of the site as they were. For decades, the
    site remained abandoned and unused.
</p>
<p>
    Then, in 1980, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched its
    “Superfund” program, which required the cleaning up of several sites in the
    country that were contaminated with hazardous waste. Weldon Spring made it
    to the list of sites that were the highest priority for cleanup. The Army
    Corps of Engineers was assigned the task, but what the Corps workers found
    baffled them. They expected the soil and vegetation around the site to be
    contaminated with the nitroaromatic wastes that had been discarded there.
    When they tested the groundwater, however, they found that the chemicals
    were showing up in people’s wells, in towns several miles from the site—a
    possibility that no one had anticipated, because the original pollution had
    been completely localized. Geologists determined that there was an enormous
    plume of contamination in the water below the TNT factory—a plume that over
    the previous 35 years had flowed through fissures in the limestone rock to
    other parts of the aquifer.
</p>
<p>
    The Weldon Spring story may sound like an exceptional case of clumsy
    planning combined with a particularly vulnerable geological structure. But
    in fact there is nothing exceptional about it all. Across the United
    States, as well as in parts of Europe, Asia, and Latin America, human
    activities are sending massive quantities of chemicals and pollutants into
    groundwater. This isn’t entirely new, of course; the subterranean world has
    always been a receptacle for whatever we need to dispose of—whether our
    sewage, our garbage, or our dead. But the enormous volumes of waste we now
    send underground, and the deadly mixes of chemicals involved, have created
    problems never before imagined.
</p>
<p>
    What Weldon Spring shows is that we can’t always anticipate where the
    pollution is going to turn up in our water, or how long it will be from the
    time it was deposited until it reappears. Because groundwater typically
    moves very slowly—at a speed of less than a foot a day, in some
    cases—damage done to aquifers may not show up for decades. In many parts of
    the world, we are only just beginning to discover contamination caused by
    practices of 30 or 40 years ago.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the most egregious cases of aquifer contamination now being
    unearthed date back to Cold War era nuclear testing and weapons-making, for
    example.
</p>
<p>
    And once it gets into groundwater, the pollution usually persists: the
    enormous volume, inaccessibility, and slow rate at which groundwater moves
    make aquifers virtually impossible to purify.
</p>
<p>
    As this covert crisis unfolds, we are barely beginning to understand its
    dimensions. Few countries track the health of their aquifers—their enormous
    size and remoteness make them extremely expensive to monitor. As the new
    century begins, even hydrogeologists and health officials have only a hazy
    impression of the likely extent of groundwater damage in different parts of
    the world. . . .
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>THE FILTER THAT FAILED: PESTICIDES IN YOUR WATER</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Pesticides are designed to kill. The first synthetic pesticides were
    introduced in the 1940s, but it took several decades of increasingly heavy
    use before it became apparent that these chemicals were injuring non-target
    organisms—including humans. One reason for the delay was that some groups
    of pesticides, such as organochlorines, usually have little effect until
    they bioaccumulate. Their concentration in living tissue increases as they
    move up the food chain. So eventually, the top predators—birds of prey, for
    example—may end up carrying a disproportionately high burden of the toxin.
    But bioaccumulation takes time, and it may take still more time before the
    effects are discovered. In cases where reproductive systems are affected,
    the aftermath of this chemical accumulation may not show up for a
    generation.
</p>
<p>
    Even when the health concerns of some pesticides were recognized in the
    1960s, it was easily assumed that the real dangers lay in the dispersal of
    these chemicals among animals and plants—not deep underground.
</p>
<p>
    It was assumed that very little pesticide would leach below the upper
    layers of soil, and that if it did, it would be degraded before it could
    get any deeper. Soil, after all, is known to be a natural filter, which
    purifies water as it trickles through. It was thought that industrial or
    agricultural chemicals, like such natural contaminants as rock dust, or
    leaf mold, would be filtered out as the water percolated through the soil.
</p>
<p>
    But over the past 35 years, this seemingly safe assumption has proved
    mistaken. Cases of extensive pesticide contamination of groundwater have
    come to light in farming regions of the United States, Western Europe,
    Latin America, and South Asia.
</p>
<p>
    What we now know is that pesticides not only leach into aquifers, but
    sometimes remain there long after the chemical is no longer used. DDT, for
    instance, is still found in U.S. waters even though its use was banned 30
    years ago. In the San Joaquin Valley of California, the soil fumigant DBCP
    (dibromochloropropane), which was used intensively in fruit orchards before
    it was banned in 1977, still lurks in the region’s water supplies. Of 4,507
    wells sampled by the USGS between 1971 and 1988, nearly a third had DBCP
    levels that were at least 10 times higher than allowed by the current
    drinking water standard.
</p>
<p>
    In places where organochlorines are still widely used, the risks continue
    to mount. After half a century of spraying in the eastern Indian states of
    West Bengal and Bihar, for example, the Central Pollution Control Board
    found DDT in groundwater at levels as high as 4,500 micrograms per
    liter—several thousand times higher than what is considered a safe dose.
</p>
<p>
    The amount of chemical that reaches groundwater depends on the amount used
    above ground, the geology of the region, and the characteristics of the
    pesticide itself. In some parts of the midwestern United States, for
    example, although pesticides are used intensively, the impermeable soils of
    the region make it difficult for the chemicals to percolate underground.
    The fissured aquifers of southern Arizona, Florida, Maine, and southern
    California, on the other hand, are very vulnerable to pollution—and these
    too are places where pesticides are applied in large quantities.
</p>
<p>
    Pesticides are often found in combination, because most farms use a range
    of toxins to destroy different kinds of insects, fungi, and plant diseases.
    The USGS detected two or more pesticides in groundwater at nearly a quarter
    of the sites sampled in its National Water Quality Assessment between 1993
    and 1995. In the Central Columbia Plateau aquifer, which extends over the
    states of Washington and Idaho, more than two-thirds of water samples
    contained multiple pesticides.
</p>
<p>
    Scientists aren’t entirely sure what happens when these chemicals and their
    various metabolites come together. We don’t even have standards for the
    many hundred <em>individual </em>pesticides in use—the EPA has drinking
    water standards for just 33 of these compounds—to say nothing of the
    infinite variety of toxic blends now trickling into the groundwater.
</p>
<p>
    While the most direct impacts may be on the water we drink, there is also
    concern about what occurs when the pesticideladen water below farmland is
    pumped back up for irrigation. One apparent consequence is a reduction in
    crop yields. In 1990, the now-defunct U.S. Office of Technology Assessment
    reported that herbicides in shallow groundwater had the effect of “pruning”
    crop roots, thereby retarding plant growth.

    <strong>From Green Revolution to Blue Baby: </strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>The Slow Creep of Nitrogen</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Since the early 1950s, farmers all over the world have stepped up their use
    of nitrogen fertilizers. Global fertilizer use has grown ninefold in that
    time. But the larger doses of nutrients often can’t be fully utilized by
    plants. A study conducted over a 140,000 square kilometer
    [54,054-square-mile] region of Northern China, for example, found that
    crops used on average only 40 percent of the nitrogen that was applied. An
    almost identical degree of waste was found in Sri Lanka. Much of the excess
    fertilizer dissolves in irrigation water, eventually trickling through the
    soil into underlying aquifers.
</p>
<p>
    Joining the excess chemical fertilizer from farm crops is the organic waste
    generated by farm animals, and the sewage produced by cities. Livestock
    waste forms a particularly potent tributary to the stream of excess
    nutrients flowing into the environment, because of its enormous volume. In
    the United States, farm animals produce 130 times as much waste as the
    country’s people do—with the result that millions of tons of cow and pig
    feces are washed into streams and rivers, and some of the nitrogen they
    carry ends up in groundwater. To this Augean [extremely difficult and
    distasteful] burden can be added the innumerable leaks and overflows from
    urban sewage systems, the fertilizer runoff from suburban lawns, golf
    courses, and landscaping, and the nitrates leaking (along with other
    pollutants) from landfills.
</p>
<p>
    There is very little historical information available about trends in the
    pollution of aquifers. But several studies show that nitrate concentrations
    have increased as fertilizer applications and population size have grown.
    In California’s San Joaquin– Tulare Valley, for instance, nitrate levels in
    groundwater increased 2.5 times between the 1950s and 1980s—a period in
    which fertilizer inputs grew six-fold.
</p>
<p>
    Levels in Danish groundwater have nearly tripled since the 1940s. As with
    pesticides, the aftermath of this multi-sided assault of excess nutrients
    has only recently begun to become visible, in part because of the slow
    speed at which nitrate moves
</p>
<p>
    underground.
</p>
<p>
    What happens when nitrates get into drinking water? Consumed in high
    concentrations—at levels above 10 milligrams (mg) per liter, but usually on
    the order of 100 mg/liter—they can cause infant methemoglobinemia, or
    so-called blue-baby syndrome. Because of their low gastric acidity, infant
    digestive systems convert nitrate to nitrite,which blocks the
    oxygen-carrying capacity of a baby’s blood, causing suffocation and death.
</p>
<p>
    Since 1945, about 3,000 cases have been reported worldwide—nearly half of
    them in Hungary, where private wells have particularly high concentrations
    of nitrates. Ruminant livestock such as goats, sheep, and cows, are
    vulnerable to methemoglobinemia in much the same way infants are, because
    their digestive systems also quickly convert nitrate to nitrite. Nitrates
    are also implicated in digestive tract cancers, although the
    epidemiological link is still uncertain.
</p>
<p>
    In cropland, nitrate pollution of groundwater can have a paradoxical
    effect. Too much nitrate can weaken plants’ immune systems, making them
    more vulnerable to pests and disease. So when nitrate-laden groundwater is
    used to irrigate crops that are also being fertilized, the net effect may
    be to reduce, rather than to increase production. This kind of
    overfertilizing makes wheat more susceptible to wheat rust, for example,
    and it makes pear trees more vulnerable to fire blight.
</p>
<p>
    In assembling studies of groundwater from around the world, we have found
    that nitrate pollution is pervasive—but has become particularly severe in
    the places where human population—and the demand for high food
    productivity—is most concentrated.
</p>
<p>
    In the northern Chinese counties of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Shandong,
    nitrate concentrations in groundwater exceeded 50 mg/liter in more than
    half of the locations studied. (The World Health Organization [WHO]
    drinking water guideline is 10 mg/liter.) In some places, the concentration
    had risen as high as 300 mg/liter. Since then, these levels may have
    increased, as fertilizer applications have escalated since the tests were
    carried out in 1995 and will likely increase even more as China’s
    population (and demand for food) swells, and as more farmland is lost to
    urbanization, industrial development, nutrient depletion, and erosion.
</p>
<p>
    Reports from other regions show similar results. The USGS found that about
    15 percent of shallow groundwater sampled below agricultural and urban
    areas in the United States had nitrate concentrations higher than the 10
    mg/liter guideline. In Sri Lanka, 79 percent of wells sampled by the
    British Geological Survey had nitrate levels that exceeded this guideline.
</p>
<p>
    Some 56 percent of wells tested in the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico had
    levels above 45 mg/liter. And the European Topic Centre on Inland Waters
    found that in Romania and Moldova, more than 35 percent of the sites
    sampled had nitrate concentrations higher than 50 mg/liter.

    <strong>From Tank of Gas to Drinking Glass: </strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>The Pervasiveness of Petrochemicals</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Drive through any part of the United States, and you’ll probably pass more
    gas stations than schools or churches.As you pull into a station to fill
    up, it may not occur to you that you’re parked over one of the most
    pervasive threats to groundwater: an underground storage tank (UST) for
    petroleum.
</p>
<p>
    Many of these tanks were installed two or three decades ago and, having
    been left in place long past their expected lifetimes, have rusted through
    in places—allowing a steady leakage of gasoline into the ground. Because
    they’re underground, they’re expensive to dig up and repair, so the leakage
    in some cases continues for years.
</p>
<p>
    Petroleum and its associated chemicals—benzene, toluene, and gasoline
    additives such as MTBE [methyl tertiary-butyl ether]—constitute the most
    common category of groundwater contaminant found in aquifers in the United
    States.
</p>
<p>
    Many of these chemicals are also known or suspected to be cancer-causing.
    In 1998, the EPA found that over 100,000 commercially owned petroleum USTs
    were leaking, of which close to 18,000 are known to have contaminated
    groundwater. In Texas, 223 of 254 counties report leaky USTs, resulting in
    a silent disaster that, according to the EPA, “has affected, or has the
    potential to affect, virtually every major and minor aquifer in the state.”
    Household tanks, which store home heating oil, are a problem as well.
    Although the household tanks aren’t subject to the same regulations and
    inspections as commercial ones, the EPA says they are “undoubtedly
    leaking.”
</p>
<p>
    Outside the United States, the world’s ubiquitous petroleum storage tanks
    are even less monitored, but spot tests suggest that the threat of leakage
    is omnipresent in the industrialized world. In 1993, petroleum giant Shell
    reported that a third of its 1,100 gas stations in the United Kingdom were
    known to have contaminated soil and groundwater.
</p>
<p>
    Another example comes from the eastern Kazakh town of Semipalatinsk, where
    6,460 tons of kerosene have collected in an aquifer under a military
    airport, seriously threatening the region’s water supplies.
</p>
<p>
    The widespread presence of petrochemicals in groundwater constitutes a kind
    of global malignancy, the danger of which has grown unobtrusively because
    there is such a great distance between cause and effect. An underground
    tank, for example, may take years to rust; it probably won’t begin leaking
    until long after the people who bought it and installed it have left their
    jobs. Even after it begins to leak, it may take several more years before
    appreciable concentrations of chemicals appear in the aquifer—and it will
    likely be years beyond that before any health effects show up in the local
    population. By then, the trail may be decades old. So it’s quite possible
    that any cancers occurring today as a result of leaking USTs might
    originate from tanks that were installed half a century ago. At that time,
    there were gas tanks sufficient to fuel 53 million cars in the world; today
    there are enough to fuel almost 10 times that number.

    <strong>FROM SEDIMENT TO SOLUTE: </strong>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>THE EMERGING THREAT OF NATURAL CONTAMINANTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the early 1990s, several villagers living near India’s West Bengal
    border with Bangladesh began to complain of skin sores that wouldn’t go
    away. A researcher at Calcutta’s Jadavpur University, Dipankar Chakraborti,
    recognized the lesions immediately as early symptoms of chronic arsenic
    poisoning. In later stages, the disease can lead to gangrene, skin cancer,
    damage to vital organs, and eventually, death. In the months that followed,
    Chakraborti began to get letters from doctors and hospitals in Bangladesh,
    who were seeing streams of patients with similar symptoms. By 1995, it was
    clear that the country faced a crisis of untold proportions, and that the
    source of the poisoning was water from tubewells, from which 90 percent of
    the country gets its drinking water.
</p>
<p>
    Experts estimate that today, arsenic in drinking water could threaten the
    health of 20 to 60 million Bangladeshis— up to half the country’s
    population—and another 6 to 30 million people in West Bengal As many as 1
    million wells in the region may be contaminated with the heavy metal at
    levels between 5 and 100 times the WHO drinking water guideline of 0.01
    mg/liter.
</p>
<p>
    How did the arsenic get into groundwater? Until the early 1970s, rivers and
    ponds supplied most of Bangladesh’s drinking water. Concerned about the
    risks of water-borne disease, the WHO and international aid agencies
    launched a well-drilling program to tap groundwater instead. However, the
    agencies, not aware that soils of the Ganges aquifers are naturally rich in
    arsenic, didn’t test the sediment before drilling tubewells. Because the
    effects of chronic arsenic poisoning can take up to 15 years to appear, the
    epidemic was not addressed until it was well under way.
</p>
<p>
    Scientists are still debating what chemical reactions released the arsenic
    from the mineral matrix in which it is naturally bound up. Some theories
    implicate human activities. One hypothesis is that as water was pumped out
    of the wells, atmospheric oxygen entered the aquifer, oxidizing the iron
    pyrite sediments, and causing the arsenic to dissolve. An October 1999
    article in the scientific journal <em>Nature </em>by geologists from the
    Indian Institute of Technology suggests that phosphates from fertilizer
    runoff and decaying organic matter may have played a role. The nutrient
    might have spurred the growth of soil microorganisms, which helped to
    loosen arsenic from sediments.
</p>
<p>
    Salt is another naturally occurring groundwater pollutant that is
    introduced by human activity. Normally, water in coastal aquifers empties
    into the sea. But when too much water is pumped out of these aquifers, the
    process is reversed: seawater moves inland and enters the aquifer. Because
    of its high salt content, just 2 percent of seawater mixed with freshwater
    makes the water unusable for drinking or irrigation. And once salinized, a
    freshwater aquifer can remain contaminated for a very long time. Brackish
    aquifers often have to be abandoned because treatment can be very
    expensive.
</p>
<p>
    In Manila, where water levels have fallen 50 to 80 meters [55 to 88 yards]
    because of overdraft, seawater has flowed as far as 5 kilometers [3 miles]
    into the Guadalupe aquifer that lies below the city. Saltwater has traveled
    several kilometers inland into aquifers beneath Jakarta and Madras, and in
    parts of the U.S. state of Florida. Saltwater intrusion is also a serious
    problem on islands such as the Maldives and Cyprus, which are very
    dependent on aquifers for water supply. Fluoride is another natural
    contaminant that threatens millions in parts of Asia. Aquifers in the drier
    regions of western India, northern China, and parts of Thailand and Sri
    Lanka are naturally rich in fluoride deposits. Fluoride is an essential
    nutrient for bone and dental health, but when consumed in high
    concentrations, it can lead to crippling damage to the neck and back, and
    to a range of dental problems. The WHO estimates that 70 million people in
    northern China, and 30 million in northwestern India are drinking water
    with high fluoride levels.

    <strong>A CHEMICAL SOUP</strong>
</p>
<p>
    With just over a million residents, Ludhiana is the largest city in Punjab,
    India’s breadbasket state. It is also an important industrial town, known
    for its textile factories, electroplating industries, and metal foundries.
    Although the city is entirely dependent on groundwater, its wells are now
    so polluted with industrial and urban wastes that the water is no longer
    safe to drink. Samples show high levels of cyanide, cadmium, lead, and
    pesticides. “Ludhiana City’s groundwater is just short of poison,” laments
    a senior official at India’s Central Ground Water Board.
</p>
<p>
    Like Ludhiana’s residents, more than a third of the planet’s people live
    and work in densely settled cities, which occupy just 2 percent of the
    Earth’s land area. With the labor force thus concentrated, factories and
    other centers of employment also group together around the same urban
    areas. Aquifers in these areas are beginning to mirror the increasing
    density and diversity of the human activity above them. Whereas the
    pollutants emanating from hog farms or copper mines may be quite
    predictable, the waste streams flowing into the water under cities contain
    a witch’s brew of contaminants.
</p>
<p>
    Ironically, a major factor in such contamination is that in most places
    people have learned to dispose of waste—to remove it from sight and
    smell—so effectively that it is easy to forget that the Earth is a closed
    ecological system in which nothing permanently disappears. The methods
    normally used to conceal garbage and other waste—landfills, septic tanks,
    and sewers—become the major conduits of chemical pollution of groundwater.
    In the United States, businesses drain almost 2 million kilograms [4.4
    million lbs] of assorted chemicals into septic systems each year,
    contaminating the drinking water of 1.3 million people. In many parts of
    the developing world, factories still dump their liquid effluents onto the
    ground and wait for it to disappear.
</p>
<p>
    In the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz, for example, a shallow aquifer that is
    the city’s main water source has had to soak up the brew of sulfates,
    nitrates, and chlorides dumped over it.And even protected landfills can be
    a potent source of aquifer pollution: the EPA found that a quarter of the
    landfills in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
    state of Maine, for example, had contaminated groundwater.
</p>
<p>
    In industrial countries, waste that is too hazardous to landfill is
    routinely buried in underground tanks. But as these caskets age, like
    gasoline tanks, they eventually spring leaks. In California’s Silicon
    Valley, where electronics industries store assorted waste solvents in
    underground tanks, local groundwater authorities found that 85 percent of
    the tanks they inspected had leaks. Silicon Valley now has more Superfund
    sites—most of them affecting groundwater—than any other area its size in
    the country. And 60 percent of the United States’ liquid hazardous waste—34
    billion liters of solvents, heavy metals, and radioactive materials—is
    directly injected into the ground. Although the effluents are injected
    below the deepest source of drinking water, some of these wastes have
    entered aquifers used for water supplies in parts of Florida, Texas, Ohio,
</p>
<p>
    and Oklahoma.
</p>
<p>
    Shenyang, China, and Jaipur, India, are among the scores of cities in the
    developing world that have had to seek out alternate supplies of water
    because their groundwater has become unusable. Santa Cruz has also
    struggled to find clean water. But as it has sunk deeper wells in pursuit
    of pure supplies, the effluent has traveled deeper into the aquifer to
    replace the water pumped out of it. In places where alternate supplies
    aren’t easily available, utilities will have to resort to increasingly
    elaborate filtration set-ups to make the water safe for drinking. In
    heavily contaminated areas, hundreds of different filters may be necessary.
    At present, utilities in the U.S. Midwest spend $400 million each year to
    treat water for just one chemical—atrazine, the most commonly detected
    pesticide in U.S. groundwater. When chemicals are found in unpredictable
    mixtures, rather than discretely, providing safe water may become even more
    expensive.

    <strong>ONE BODY, MANY WOUNDS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The various incidents of aquifer pollution described may seem isolated. A
    group of wells in northern China have nitrate problems; another lot in the
    United Kingdom are laced with benzene.
</p>
<p>
    In each place it might seem that the problem is local and can be contained.
    But put them together, and you begin to see a bigger picture emerging.
    Perhaps most worrisome is that we’ve discovered as much damage as we have,
    despite the very limited monitoring and testing of underground water. And
    because of the time-lags involved—and given our high levels of chemical use
    and waste generation in recent decades—what’s still to come may bring even
    more surprises.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the greatest shocks may be felt in places where chemical use and
    disposal has climbed in the last few decades, and where the most basic
    measures to shield groundwater have not been taken. In India, for example,
    the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) surveyed 22 major industrial
    zones and found that groundwater in every one of them was unfit for
    drinking. When asked about these findings, CPCB chairman D. K. Biswas
    remarked, “The result is frightening, and it is my belief that we will get
    more shocks in the future.”
</p>
<p>
    Jack Barbash, an environmental chemist at the U.S. Geological Survey,
    points out that we may not need to wait for expensive tests to alert us to
    what to expect in our groundwater. “If you want to know what you’re likely
    to find in aquifers near Shanghai or Calcutta, just look at what’s used
    above ground,” he says. “If you’ve been applying DDT to a field for 20
    United States years, for example, that’s one of the chemicals you’re likely
    to find in the underlying groundwater.” The full consequences of today’s
    chemical-dependent and waste-producing economies may not become apparent
    for another generation, but Barbash and other scientists are beginning to
    get a sense of just how serious those consequences are likely to be if
    present consumption and disposal practices continue.

    <strong>CHANGING COURSE</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Farmers in California’s San Joaquin Valley began tapping the area’s
    seemingly boundless groundwater store in the latenineteenth century. By
    1912, the aquifer was so depleted that the water table had fallen by as
    much as 400 feet [122 meters] in some places. But the farmers continued to
    tap the resource to keep up with demand for their produce. Over time, the
    dehydration of the aquifer caused its clay soil to shrink, and the ground
    began to sink—or as geologists put it, to “subside.” In some parts of the
    valley, the ground has subsided as much as 29 feet [9 meters]— cracking
    foundations, canals, and aqueducts.
</p>
<p>
    When the San Joaquin farmers could no longer pump enough groundwater to
    meet their irrigation demands, they began to bring in water from the
    northern part of the state via the California Aqueduct. The imported water
    seeped into the compacted aquifer, which was not able to hold all of the
    incoming flow. The water table then rose to an abnormally high level,
    dissolving salts and minerals in soils that had not been previously
    submerged. The salty groundwater, welling up from below, began to poison
    crop roots. In response, the farmers installed drains under irrigated
    fields—designed to capture the excess water and divert it to rivers and
    reservoirs in the valley so that it wouldn’t evaporate and leave its salts
    in the soil.
</p>
<p>
    But the farmers didn’t realize that the rocks and soils of the region
    contained substantial amounts of the mineral selenium, which is toxic at
    high doses. Some of the selenium leached into the drainage water, which was
    routed to the region’s wetlands. It wasn’t until the mid-1980s that the
    aftermath of this solution became apparent: ecologists noticed that
    thousands of waterfowl in the nearby Kesterson Reservoir were dying of
    selenium poisoning.
</p>
<p>
    Hydrological systems are not easy to outmaneuver, and the San Joaquin
    farmers’ experience serves as a kind of cautionary tale. Each of their
    stopgap solutions temporarily took care of an immediate obstacle, but led
    to a longer-term problem more severe than the original one.“Human
    understanding has lagged one step behind the inflexible realities governing
    the aquifer system,” observes USGS hydrologist Frank Chapelle.
</p>
<p>
    Around the world, human responses to aquifer pollution thus far have
    essentially reenacted the San Joaquin Valley farmers’ well-meaning but
    inadequate approach. In many places, various authorities and industries
    have fought back the contamination leak by leak, or chemical by
    chemical—only to find that the individual fixes simply don’t add up. As we
    line landfills to reduce leakage, for instance, tons of pesticide may be
    running off nearby farms and into aquifers. As we mend holes in underground
    gas tanks, acid from mines may be seeping into groundwater.
</p>
<p>
    Clearly, it’s essential to control the damage we’ve already inflicted, and
    to protect communities and ecosystems from the poisoned fallout. But given
    what we already know—that damage done to aquifers is mostly irreversible,
    that it can take years before groundwater pollution reveals itself, that
    chemicals react synergistically, and often in unanticipated ways—it’s now
    clear that a patchwork response isn’t going to be effective. Given how much
    damage this pollution inflicts on public health, the environment, and the
    economy once it gets into the water, it’s critical that emphasis be shifted
    from filtering out toxins to not using them in the first place. Andrew
    Skinner, who heads the International Association of Hydrogeologists, puts
    it this way: “Prevention is the only credible strategy.”
</p>
<p>
    To do this requires looking not just at individual factories, gas stations,
    cornfields, and dry cleaning plants, but at the whole social, industrial,
    and agricultural systems of which these businesses are a part.
</p>
<p>
    The ecological untenability of these systems is what’s really poisoning the
    world’s water. It is the predominant system of high-input agriculture, for
    example, that not only shrinks biodiversity with its vast monocultures, but
    also overwhelms the land—and the underlying water—with its massive
    applications of agricultural chemicals. It’s the system of car-dominated,
    geographically expanding cities that not only generates unsustainable
    amounts of climate-disrupting greenhouse gases and acid rain-causing air
    pollutants, but also overwhelms aquifers and soils with petrochemicals,
    heavy metals, and sewage. An adequate response will require a thorough
    overhaul of each of these systems.
</p>
<p>
    Begin with industrial agriculture. Farm runoff is a leading cause of
    groundwater pollution in many parts of Europe, the United States, China,
    and India. Lessening its impact calls for adopting practices that sharply
    reduce this runoff—or, better still, that require far smaller inputs to
    begin with. In most places, current practices are excessively wasteful. In
    Colombia, for example, growers spray flowers with as much as 6,000 liters
    [1,585 gallons] of pesticide per hectare [a hectare is about 2.5 acres]. In
    Brazil, orchards get almost 10,000 liters [2,642 gallons] per hectare.
</p>
<p>
    Experts at the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization say that with
    modified application techniques, these chemicals could be applied at
    one-tenth those amounts and still be effective. But while using more
    efficient pesticide applications would constitute a major improvement,
    there is also the possibility of reorienting agriculture to use very little
    synthetic pesticide at all. Recent studies suggest that farms can maintain
    high yields while using little or no synthetic input. One decade-long
    investigation by the Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania, for example,
    compared traditional manure and legume-based cropping systems which used no
    synthetic fertilizer or pesticides, with a conventional, high-intensity
    system. All three fields were planted with maize and soybeans. The
    researchers found that the traditional systems retained more soil organic
    matter and nitrogen—indicators of soil fertility—and leached 60 percent
    less nitrate than the conventional system.Although organic fertilizer (like
    its synthetic

    In industrial settings, building “closed-loop” production and consumption
    systems can help slash the quantities of waste that factories and cities
    send to landfills, sewers, and dumps— thus protecting aquifers from leaking
    pollutants. In places as far-ranging as Tennessee, Fiji, Namibia, and
    Denmark, environmentally conscious investors have begun to build
    “industrial symbiosis” parks in which the unusable wastes from one firm
    become the input for another.
</p>
<p>
    An industrial park in Kalundborg, Denmark diverts more than 1.3 million
    tons of effluent from landfills and septic systems each year, while
    preventing some 135,000 tons of carbon and sulfur from leaking into the
    atmosphere. Households, too, can become a part of this systemic change by
    reusing and repairing products. In a campaign organized by the Global
    Action Plan for the Earth, an international nongovernmental organization,
    thoughtful consumption habits have enabled some 60,000 households in the
    United States and Europe to reduce their waste by 42 percent and their
    water use by 25 percent.

    As it becomes clearer to decisionmakers that the most serious threats to
    human security are no longer those of military attack but of pervasive
    environmental and social decline,experts worry about the difficulty of
    mustering sufficient political will to bring about the kinds of
    systemic—and therefore revolutionary—changes in human life necessary to
    turn the tide in time. In confronting the now heavily documented assaults
    of climate change and biodiversity loss, leaders seem on one hand paralyzed
    by how bleak the big picture appears to be—and on the other hand too easily
    drawn into denial or delay by the seeming lack of immediate consequences of
    such delay. But protecting aquifers may provide a more immediate incentive
    for change, if only because it simply may not be possible to live with
    contaminated groundwater for as long as we could make do with a gradually
    more irritable climate or polluted air or impoverished wildlife. Although
    we’ve damaged portions of some aquifers to the point of no return,
    scientists believe that a large part of the resource still remains pure—for
    the moment. That’s not likely to remain the case if we continue to depend
    on simply stepping up the present reactive tactics of cleaning up more of
    the chemical spills, replacing more of the leaking gasoline tanks, placing
    more plastic liners under landfills, or issuing more fines to careless hog
    farms and copper mines. To save the water in time requires the same
    fundamental restructuring of the global economy as does the stabilizing of
    the climate and biosphere as a whole—the rapid transition from a
    resource-depleting, oil- and coal-fueled, high-input industrial and
    agricultural economy to one that is based on renewable energy, compact
    cities, and a very light human footprint.

    <strong>“HEAVEN IS UNDER OUR FEET”</strong>
</p>

    Throughout human history, people have feared that the skies would be the
    source of great destruction. During the Cold War, industrial nations feared
    nuclear attack from above, and spent vast amounts of their wealth to avert
    it. Now some of that fear has shifted to the threats of atmospheric climate
    change: of increasing ultraviolet radiation through the ozone hole, and the
    rising intensity of global warming-driven hurricanes and typhoons. Yet, all
    the while, as the worldwide pollution of aquifers now reveals, we’ve been
    slowly poisoning ourselves from beneath. What lies under terra firma may,
    in fact, be of as much concern as what happens in the firmament above.
</p>
<p>
    The ancient Greeks created an elaborate mythology about the Underworld, or
    Hades, which they described as a dismal, lifeless place completely lacking
    the abundant fertility of the world above. Science and human experience
    have taught us differently.
</p>
<p>
    Hydrologists now know that healthy aquifers are essential to the life above
    ground—that they play a vital role not just in providing water to drink,
    but in replenishing rivers and wetlands and, through their ultimate effects
    on rainfall and climate, in nurturing the life of the land and air as
    well.But ironically,our neglectful actions now threaten to make the Greek
    myth a reality after all.To avert that threat now will require taking to
    heart what the hydrologists have found. As Henry David Thoreau observed a
    century-and-a-half ago, “Heaven is under our feet, as well as over our
    heads.”

                        “The EPA estimates that our nation needs $265 billion
                        to maintain and improve its drinking water
                        infrastructure over the next twenty years,” said
                        Senator James M. Jeffords. “If we don’t address this,

                        The following two articles explore the quality of our

                        Water: Get to Know It and Protect It,” explains the
                        basics of how the Safe Water Drinking Act (SWDA) was
                        passed in 1974 to protect our drinking water.The act
                        authorized the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
                        (EPA) to set standards for protecting all wells that
                        supply drinking water to more than 25 people. To
                        safeguard our health, the EPA has set standards for
                        safe levels of drinking water for more than 80
                        contaminants. Water suppliers are required to monitor
                        and test the drinking water. The results of these tests
                        are available for consumers to review in the water
                        supplier’s annual report. Since your body is about 70%
                        water, it’s worth investigating whether the water you
                        are putting into it is clean.

        water supplies in the world. Even so, not everyone in the country has
        clean drinking water, and keeping the supplies clean is not easy.
        Recently in Washington, D.C., thousands of homes were found to have an

        There is no such thing as naturally pure water. In nature, all water
        contains some impurities. As water flows in streams, sits in lakes, and
        filters through layers of soil and rock in the ground, it dissolves or
        absorbs the substances that it touches. Some of these substances are
        harmless. In fact, some people prefer mineral water precisely because
        minerals give it an appealing taste. However, at certain levels,
        minerals, just like man-made chemicals, are considered contaminants
        that can make water unpalatable or even unsafe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some contaminants come from erosion of natural rock formations. Other
        contaminants are substances discharged from factories, applied to
        farmlands, or used by consumers in their homes and yards. Sources of
        contaminants might be in your neighborhood or might be many miles away.
        Your local water quality report tells which contaminants are in your
        drinking water, the levels at which they were found, and the actual or
        likely source of each contaminant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some ground water systems have established wellhead protection programs
        to prevent substances from contaminating their wells. Similarly, some
        surface water systems protect the watershed around their reservoir to
        prevent contamination. Right now, states and water suppliers are
        working systematically to assess every source of drinking water and to
        identify potential sources of contaminants.This process will help
        communities to protect their drinking water supplies from
        contamination, and a summary of the results will be in future water
        quality reports.

        <strong>WHERE DOES DRINKING WATER COME FROM?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A clean, constant supply of drinking water is essential to every
        community. People in large cities frequently drink water that comes
        from surface water sources, such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs.
        Sometimes these sources are close to the community. Other times,
        drinking water suppliers get their water from sources many miles away.
        In either case, when you think about where your drinking water comes
        from, it’s important to consider not just the part of the river or lake
        that you can see, but the entire watershed. The watershed is the land
        area over which water flows into the river, lake, or reservoir.
    </p>
    <p>
        In rural areas, people are more likely to drink ground water that was
        pumped from a well. These wells tap into aquifers— the natural
        reservoirs under the earth’s surface—that may be only a few miles wide,
        or may span the borders of many states. As with surface water, it is
        important to remember that activities many miles away from you may
        affect the quality of
    </p>
    <p>
        ground water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your annual drinking water quality report will tell you where your
        water supplier gets your water.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>HOW IS DRINKING WATER TREATED?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        When a water supplier takes untreated water from a river or reservoir,
        the water often contains dirt and tiny pieces of leaves and other
        organic matter, as well as trace amounts of certain contaminants. When
        it gets to the treatment plant, water suppliers often add chemicals
        called coagulants to the water. These act on the water as it flows very
        slowly through tanks so that the dirt and other contaminants form
        clumps that settle to the bottom. Usually, this water then flows
        through a filter for removal of the smallest contaminants like viruses
        and <em>Giardia.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Most ground water is naturally filtered as it passes through layers of
        the earth into underground reservoirs known as aquifers. Water that
        suppliers pump from wells generally contains less organic material than
        surface water and may not need to go through any or all of the
        treatments described in the previous paragraph. The quality of the
        water will depend on local conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most common drinking water treatment, considered by many to be one
        of the most important scientific advances of the 20<sup>th </sup>
        century, is disinfection. Most water suppliers add chlorine or another
        disinfectant to kill bacteria and other germs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water suppliers use other treatments as needed, according to the
        quality of their source water. For example, systems whose water is
        contaminated with organic chemicals can treat their water with
        activated carbon, which adsorbs or attracts the chemicals dissolved in
        the water.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>WHAT IF I HAVE SPECIAL HEALTH NEEDS?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        People who have HIV/AIDS, are undergoing chemotherapy, take steroids,
        or for another reason have a weakened immune system may be more
susceptible to microbial contaminants, including        <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, in drinking water. If you or someone you know
        fall into one of these categories, talk to your health care provider to
        find out if you need to take special precautions, such as boiling your
        water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Young children are particularly susceptible to the effects of high
        levels of certain contaminants, including nitrate and lead. To avoid
        exposure to lead, use water from the cold tap for making baby formula,
        drinking, and cooking, and let the water run for a minute or more if
        the water hasn’t been turned on for six or more hours. If your water
        supplier alerts you that your water does not meet EPA’s standard for
        nitrates and you have children less than six months old, consult your
        health care provider.You may want to find an alternate source of water
        that contains lower levels of nitrates for your child.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>WHAT ARE THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF </strong>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>CONTAMINANTS IN DRINKING WATER?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        EPA has set standards for more than 80 contaminants that may occur in
        drinking water and pose a risk to human health. EPA sets these
        standards to protect the health of everybody, including vulnerable
        groups like children.
    </p>
    <p>
        The contaminants fall into two groups according to the health effects
        that they cause.Your local water supplier will alert you through the
        local media, direct mail, or other means if there is a potential acute
        or chronic health effect from compounds in the drinking water.You may
        want to contact them for additional information specific to your area.
    </p>
    <p>
        Acute effects occur within hours or days of the time that a person
        consumes a contaminant. People can suffer acute health effects from
        almost any contaminant if they are exposed to extraordinarily high
        levels (as in the case of a spill). In drinking water, microbes, such
        as bacteria and viruses, are the contaminants with the greatest chance
        of reaching levels high enough to cause acute health effects. Most
        people’s bodies can fight off these microbial contaminants the way they
        fight off germs, and these acute contaminants typically don’t have
        permanent effects. Nonetheless, when high enough levels occur, they can
        make people ill, and can be dangerous or deadly for a person whose
        immune system is already weak due to HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, steroid
        use, or another reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chronic effects occur after people consume a contaminant at levels over
        EPA’s safety standards for many years. The drinking water contaminants
        that can have chronic effects are chemicals (such as disinfection
        by-products, solvents, and pesticides), radionuclides (such as radium),
        and minerals (such as arsenic). Examples of these chronic effects
        include cancer, liver or kidney problems, or reproductive difficulties.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DRINKING WATER QUALITY?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Safe Drinking Water Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency
        (EPA) the responsibility for setting national drinking water standards
        that protect the health of the 250 million people who get their water
        from public water systems. Other people get their water from private
        wells which are not subject to federal regulations. Since 1974, EPA has
        set national standards for over 80 contaminants that may occur in
        drinking water.
    </p>
    <p>
        While EPA and state governments set and enforce standards, local
        governments and private water suppliers have direct responsibility for
        the quality of the water that flows to your tap.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water systems test and treat their water, maintain the distribution
        systems that deliver water to consumers, and report on their water
        quality to the state. States and EPA provide technical assistance to
        water suppliers and can take legal action against systems that fail to
        provide water that meets state and EPA standards.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>WHAT IS A VIOLATION OF A DRINKING WATER STANDARD?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Drinking water suppliers are required to monitor and test their water
        many times, for many things, before sending it to consumers. These
        tests determine whether and how the water needs to be treated, as well
        as the effectiveness of the treatment process. If a water system
        consistently sends to consumers water that contains a contaminant at a
        level higher than EPA or state health standards or if the system fails
        to monitor for a contaminant, the system is violating regulations, and
        is subject to fines and other penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a water system violates a drinking water regulation, it must
        notify the people who drink its water about the violation, what it
        means, and how they should respond. In cases where the water presents
        an immediate health threat, such as when people need to boil water
        before drinking it, the system must use television, radio, and
        newspapers to get the word out as quickly as possible. Other notices
        may be sent by mail, or delivered with the water bill. Each water
        suppliers’ annual water quality report must include a summary of all
        the violations that occurred during the previous year.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>HOW CAN I HELP PROTECT DRINKING WATER?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the new information that is now available about drinking water,
        citizens can both be aware of the challenges of keeping drinking water
        safe and take an active role in protecting drinking water. There are
        lots of ways that individuals can get involved. Some people will help
        clean up the watershed that is the source of their community’s water.
        Other people might get involved in wellhead protection activities to
        prevent the contamination of the ground water source that provides
        water to their community. These people will be able to make use of the
        information that states and water systems are gathering as they assess
        their sources of water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other people will want to attend public meetings to ensure that the
        community’s need for safe drinking water is considered in making
        decisions about land use. You may wish to participate as your state and
        water system make funding decisions. And all consumers can do their
        part to conserve water and to dispose properly of household chemicals.

        <strong>Is Your Drinking Water Safe?</strong>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        by Rene Ebersole
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s clear, smells fresh, tastes good. But is it safe to drink? Most of
        us have considered this question, whether sipping tap water while
        traveling or making lemonade at home. Truth is American water supplies
        are some of the cleanest in the world. Still, it sure doesn’t hurt to
        be cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
        Case in point: The nation’s capital, where thousands of residents
        discovered last winter [2003–2004] that their tap water was tainted
        with dangerous levels of lead, a metal associated with behavioral
        problems, brain damage and lowered IQ in children, and strokes, cancer
        and elevated blood pressure in adults.
    </p>
    <p>
        More than two-thirds of the 6,000 Washington, D.C., households that had
        their water tested for lead were found to exceed the Environmental
        Protection Agency’s (EPA) hazard level of 15 parts per billion
        (ppb)—157 homes had levels above 300 ppb. When the test results hit the
        news in January [2004], city officials scrambled to root out the source
        of the contamination and ramped up efforts to replace lead service
        pipes that transmit water underground to customers’ homes.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the same time, residents stormed department stores, looking for home
        water filtration systems that would protect their families from the
        invisible toxin.
    </p>
    <p>
        The District of Columbia is home to one of the roughly three dozen
        water systems in the country with lead levels above the federal safety
        standard, according to data collected by the EPA. (Most of the others
        are in smaller communities.) But lead isn’t the only contaminant in the
        nation’s public water supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some studies estimate that as many as seven million Americans become
        sick from contaminated tap water each year. Often to blame are aging
        pipes that break, leach contaminants into water and breed bacteria, as
well as old-fashioned treatment facilities that can fail to remove 21        <sup>st </sup>century contaminants. Exacerbating the problem are
        environmental threats—stormwater runoff, agricultural pesticides and
        fertilizers, industrial pollution, hazardous waste and oil and chemical
        spills.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Most Americans take it for granted that their tap water is pure and
        their water infrastructure is safe,” says Erik Olson, senior attorney
        with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). “They shouldn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
        A recent NRDC report authored by Olson found the quality of drinking
        water in 19 major U.S. cities might pose health risks to some
        residents, especially those with compromised immune systems. Of all the
        cities studied, five had apparent or confirmed violations of
        enforceable tap water laws. The cities with the poorest water quality
        were Albuquerque, Boston, Fresno, Phoenix and San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water utilities are required by law to provide consumers with
        information about where municipal water comes from, whether it exceeds
        the allowable limits of the 80 possible contaminants regulated by the
        EPA and the health risks to which they may be exposed by drinking tap
        water.“If a system fails to monitor for a contaminant, it is subject to
        fines and penalties,” says EPA spokesperson Cathy Milbourn. Utilities
        are required to mail these “consumer confidence reports” by July each
        year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Can the utilities’ reports be trusted? According to NRDC, sometimes
        yes, sometimes no. Olson and his colleagues carefully evaluated the
        utility reports of the 19 cities. They determined that some, such as
        Chicago, Denver and Detroit, were doing a “good job.” Others, including
        Atlanta, Boston, Houston, Newark, Phoenix, Seattle and Washington,
        D.C., published information that was “incomplete or misleading.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Studies show that it will take from $230 to $500 billion— more than
        $300 million in Washington, D.C., alone—to restore and upgrade the
        nation’s aging and outdated water systems. Some experts criticize the
        Bush administration for providing insufficient funding for such an
        important endeavor, and instead attempting to weaken the bedrock
        environmental laws that protect the nation’s drinking water supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
        At press time [July 2004], Congress was considering the
        administration’s proposal to revoke Clean Water Act protections for
        more than 20 million acres [8.1 million hectares] of wetlands that
        naturally filter pollutants and provide clean drinking water to
        American towns and cities. The administration did, however, cancel
        plans last winter to issue a new rule limiting the types of waters
        protected under the Clean Water Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Clean drinking water has been one of the major public health triumphs
        of the past 100 years,” says David Ozonoff, a professor at Boston
        University’s School of Public Health and an expert on waterborne
        illnesses. “We’ve figured out how to build very efficient water
        delivery systems. But these systems can either provide safe drinking
        water, or deliver poisons and harmful organisms into every home, school
        and workplace. One misstep can lead to disaster, so we must vigorously
        protect our watersheds and use the best technology to purify our tap
        water.”

                        We now have the scientific data to know that the things
                        people do—from growing food and fertilizing their
                        lawns, to disposing of waste and making plastics, to
                        mining and burning coal—cause pollution in our oceans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might think that the major causes of pollution are
                        oil tanker spills and garbage dumped out at sea.
                        However, a report by the National Research Council
                        (2002) showed that in one year, more oil flows off of
                        our roads and parking lots (16 million gallons) than
                        was dumped by the 1989 <em>Exxon Valdez </em>oil spill
                        (10.9 million gallons). In fact, it is this nonpoint
                        pollution that is the largest pollution source in our
                        coastal waters. And the loss of our coastal wetlands,
                        which act as biological filters, makes this pollution
                        an even more serious problem. The loss of coastal
                        wetlands results from a weakening of the protection
                        that was once afforded coastal wetlands under the Clean
                        Water Act.

                    <p>
                        The following chapter from the Pew Oceans Commission’s
                        2003 report states that in 2001, more than 13,000 U.S.
                        beaches were closed because of pollution or had
                        pollution advisories. But the pollution is not just
                        confined to the shores. Orca whales have high
                        polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels, and some species
                        of deep-sea fish are too filled with mercury to be safe
                        for people to eat. The Pew report states that today our
                        oceans are facing as great a danger as our rivers and
                        lakes did in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when some
                        polluted rivers caught fire. Nitrogen run-off from
                        fertilizers causes algae to bloom and allows seasonal
                        “dead zones,” or areas in which the fish have died from
                        lack of oxygen, to appear. At times, the dead zone in
                        the Gulf of Mexico is as large as the entire state of
                        Massachusetts.

                    <p>
                        Point sources of pollution are still a problem.
                        Regulations for cruise ships, ballast-discharge from
                        ships, and concentrated animal feeding operations are
                        sometimes poorly enforced. Invasive species and sound
                        pollution also degrade our oceans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But science tells us that we can improve. For example,
                        coastal waters around Los Angeles and San Diego have
                        dramatically improved over the last 25 years. Just as

        What we are less aware of,however,is the amount of pollution that
        travels daily from each of our lawns, vehicle tailpipes, driveways, and
        the fields where our food is produced into our coastal waters. A recent
        [2002] study by the National Research Council found that the same
        amount of oil released in the <em>Exxon Valdez </em>spill—10.9 million
        gallons—washes off our coastal lands and into the surrounding waters
        every eight months. The Mississippi River, which drains nearly 40
        percent of the continental United States, carries an estimated 1.5
        million metric tons of nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico each year.
        Overall, the amount of nitrogen released into coastal waters along the
        Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico from anthropogenic, or
        human-induced sources, has increased about fivefold since the
        preindustrial era.
    </p>
    <p>
        The consequences of this polluted runoff are most acute along the
        coasts, where more than 13,000 beaches were closed
    </p>

<p>
    or under pollution advisories in 2001. Two-thirds of our estuaries and bays
    are either moderately or severely degraded from eutrophication. However,
    pollution’s reach extends far beyond our major cities. Scientists report
    that killer whales have higher PCB levels in their blubber than any animal
    on the planet and that fish species that live their entire lives far out in
    the Pacific are too contaminated with mercury to be safe to eat.
</p>
<p>
    These are the signs of a silent crisis in our oceans.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, we have set a good precedent for addressing water pollution.
    In response to public outcry over such environmental calamities as the
    burning of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, Congress passed the Clean Water Act
    (CWA) in 1972. The law requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) to establish national technology standards and science-based criteria
    for water quality protection. The states then control identifiable sources
    of pollution by issuing pollution discharge permits based on these
    technology and water quality requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Efforts resulting from the provisions of the Clean Water Act have succeeded
    in removing the worst pollution from the rivers and lakes that surround
    us.Some coastal waters,such as those off Los Angeles and San Diego, have
    dramatically improved. There, inputs of many pollutants have been reduced
    by 90 percent or more over a 25-year period, leading to the recovery of
    kelp beds, fish communities, and certain seabird populations.
</p>
<p>
    But in the 30 years since the Clean Water Act was passed, as scientific
    knowledge and experience has improved, the focus of our concern has
    shifted. Although controlling point sources remains critical, the subtler
    problem of nonpoint sources has moved to the fore. In our oceans, now, we
    are experiencing a crisis as great as a burning river. It is a crisis we
    must address through changes in both policy and commitment.
</p>
<p>
    Today, nonpoint sources present the greatest pollution threat to our oceans
    and coasts. Every acre of farmland and stretch of road in a watershed is a
    nonpoint source. Every treated lawn in America contributes toxins and
    nutrients to our coasts. Nonpoint pollutants include excess fertilizers and
    pesticides used in farming, oil and grease from paved surfaces, bacteria
    and nutrients from livestock manure, and acidic or toxic drainage from
    abandoned mines.
</p>
<p>
    The current legal framework is ill equipped to address this threat. Rather
    than confronting individual cases, the situation requires that we apply new
    thinking about the connection between the land and the sea, and the role
    watersheds play in providing habitat and reducing pollution.
</p>
<p>
    One of the major nonpoint pollutants is nitrogen, a nutrient that
    encourages plant growth. Although nitrogen is essential to life, in excess
    it can significantly damage and alter ecosystems. In fact, scientists now
    believe that nutrients are the primary pollution threat to living marine
    resources. Most nitrogen in the oceans arrives from nonpoint sources,
    including storm runoff from roads and agricultural fields, and airborne
    nitrogen emitted from power plants and car tailpipes.
</p>
<p>
    We have also learned that marine species accumulate toxic substances. From
    single-celled marine life to top ocean predators, including humans, toxic
    substance levels in body tissue increase as predators consume contaminated
    prey. In addition, new forms of pollution are emerging. Non-native species,
    introduced by accident or design, have proliferated to stress entire
    ecosystems, crowding out native species, altering habitat, and in some
    instances, introducing disease. And human-generated sound in the oceans is
    affecting marine life in ways we are just beginning to understand.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, we have not fully dispensed with the problem of point source
    pollution. Legal loopholes and poor enforcement allow significant point
    sources of pollution to go unregulated. These include cruise ships,
    ballast-water discharge from ships, and concentrated animal feeding
    operations. Animal feeding operations alone produce more than three times
    the amount of waste that people do—about 500 million tons of manure every
    year.
</p>
<p>
    Through witness testimony from around the country, commissioned papers, and
    its own research, the [Pew Oceans]
</p>
<p>
    Commission investigated five types of pollution—nutrients, toxic
    substances, cruise ship discharges, invasive species, and anthropogenic
    sound. It reviewed the current state of our laws and changes necessary to
    control new and overlooked sources
</p>
<p>
    of pollution.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>WHEN NUTRIENTS POLLUTE</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The immediate cause of the 1991 event that killed one million menhaden in
North Carolina’s Neuse River was a single-celled creature called<em>Pfiestera piscicida</em>. Known as the killer alga,    <em>P. piscicida </em>can emit a strong neurotoxin when in the presence of
    schools of fish. It feasts on the dead and dying fish, reproduces, and then
settles back into the sediment. Scientists have found that    <em>P. piscicida </em>thrives in coastal waters that are enriched with
    nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen.
</p>
<p>
    The Neuse River outbreak was linked by analyses of the event to nutrients
    flowing from manure lagoons and other agricultural sources in the
    watershed.
</p>
<p>
    We are degrading the environment along our coasts. Nutrient pollution has
    been linked to harmful algal blooms, such as the <em>Pfiestera </em>
    outbreak. It has also been linked to dead zones, such as the area in the
    Gulf of Mexico that appears annually and has reached the size of
    Massachusetts (more than 8,000 square miles [20,720 km<sup>2</sup>]). In
    addition, this pollution results in the loss of seagrass and kelp beds,
    destruction of coral reefs, and lowered biodiversity in estuaries and
    coastal habitats. The incidence of harmful algal blooms along the United
    States coastlines increased from 200 in the decade of the 1970s to 700 in
    the 1990s, and now includes almost every coastal state in the U.S. One
    bloom off the coast of Florida was implicated in the deaths of more than
    150 manatees.
</p>
<p>
    The continued loss of wetlands is further evidence of this trend in
    degradation. Wetlands serve a critical function as natural filters that
    remove nutrients before they can reach the sea, but they are being lost at
    the rate of approximately 60,000 acres per year. If current practices of
    nutrient input and habitat destruction continue, nitrogen inputs to U.S.
    coastal waters in 2030 may be 30 percent higher than at present.
</p>
<p>
    When too many nutrients—particularly nitrogen—enter the marine environment,
    the result is eutrophication—the overenrichment of the water that
    stimulates extraordinary growth of phytoplankton and attached algae.
    Phytoplankton blooms can be so dense they block the light needed by corals
    and by submerged vegetation such as seagrasses. Severe light deprivation
    will kill the plants and cause corals to expel the algae they host, which
    leads to coral bleaching.
</p>
<p>
    After the phytoplankton die and sink to the ocean floor, bacteria decompose
    them. Decomposition pulls oxygen from the water, leaving the remaining
    plants and animals oxygenstarved. Areas with little oxygen, called hypoxic,
    are unable to support fish and shrimp populations, and the stress of
    hypoxia can make them more vulnerable to invasive species, disease, and
    mortality events. In addition to the well-known hypoxic dead zone at the
    mouth of the Mississippi River, hypoxic zones have developed in 39
    estuaries around the U.S. coast.
</p>
<p>
    Of the myriad sources of nutrient pollution, agriculture is the most
    significant. Nitrogen in fertilizer is easily dissolved in and transported
    by water. Animal wastes are also nitrogen rich, and are generally applied
    to farmland, where the nitrogen can be washed into water bodies by
    rainstorms. Aggravating this problem, tile drainage systems constructed to
    collect and shuttle excess water from fields—particularly common in the
    corn and soybean fields of the Midwest—provide an expressway for nitrogen
    flowing into waterways.
</p>
<p>
    Until recently, atmospheric deposition—the settling of airborne pollutants
    on the land and water—has been an overlooked source of nitrogen pollution
    in coastal waters. It is now clear that it is widespread and quantitatively
    important in some regions. Most atmospheric deposition of nitrogen
    originates as nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants and automobiles,
    and ammonia gas released from animal wastes.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to nonpoint sources, there are major point sources of
    nutrients, particularly concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs).
    Most animal wastes from CAFOs are stored in open lagoons, which can be
    larger than five and a half football fields and contain 20 to 45 million
    gallons of wastewater. If not properly managed, lagoons can leach nutrients
    and other substances into waterways and overflow during rainstorms. The
    liquid effluent, rich in nitrogen and phosphorous, is sprayed onto
    agricultural fields as fertilizer, often at many times the amount needed
    for crop growth. On a day-to-day basis, the over-application of animal
    waste to land, which fouls waterways with runoff, is a significant
    environmental problem.
</p>
<p>
    Although they are regulated under the CWA [Clean Water Act], CAFOs have
    largely avoided pollution restrictions because of exemptions in outdated
    regulations and the states’ failure to enforce permitting requirements. Of
    the approximately 15,500 operations that meet EPA’s definition triggering
    regulation, less than 30 percent have permits, reducing the government’s
    and the public’s ability to monitor and control CAFO-related pollution. EPA
    recently revised its CAFO regulations, which now expressly require all
    CAFOs over a certain size to obtain a point source discharge permit. EPA’s
    new regulations require CAFOs to develop a nutrient management plan by
    2006, but EPA has not set enforceable standards for these plans, which will
    be written by the operators and not subject to government or public review.
    In exchange for developing and implementing a nutrient management plan,
    CAFOs are shielded from liability for pollution that is discharged off the
    facility’s land application area.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of its source, nitrogen has become one of the most pervasive and
    harmful pollutants in coastal waters. A revitalized pollution policy must
    reflect this understanding.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>TOXIC WATERS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When the <em>Exxon Valdez </em>ran aground in Alaska and spilled its oil
    cargo in March 1989, scientists, managers, and hundreds of volunteers
    rushed to rescue thousands of seabirds and sea otters. They picked the
    birds off soiled beaches and attempted to clean their plumage before the
    birds lost their ability to float and to stay warm. In the end, some 30,000
    seabirds perished as well as 1,000 or more sea otters, and untold numbers
    of fish.
</p>
<p>
    Congress has since passed the Oil Pollution Act to reduce the risk of
    similar tanker accidents.
</p>
<p>
    New evidence strongly suggests that components of crude oil, called
    polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), persist in the marine environment
    for years and are toxic to marine life at concentrations in the low
    parts-per-billion range. Chronic exposure to PAHs can affect development,
    increase susceptibility to disease, and jeopardize normal reproductive
    cycles in many
</p>
<p>
    marine species.
</p>
<p>
    PAHs represent just one class of toxic substances that threaten the health
    of marine species and of humans who depend upon them for food. The
    Commission focused on three toxic substances of particular concern: PAHs,
    PCBs (polycholorinated biphenyls), and heavy metals like mercury. These
    substances are both pervasive and persistent. They are decomposed very
    slowly, if at all, by bacteria, and do not leave the marine environment
    quickly or completely. Although now banned in domestic manufacture of
    electrical transformers, plastics, paints, and other materials, PCBs are
    still present in many imported materials and at many industrial and
    military sites. Mercury levels are on the rise in some regions. Nearly 80
    percent of the mercury in the marine environment arrives as air emissions
    from coal-fired power plants and other combustion sources, some of them
    overseas.
</p>
<p>
    Landfills, urban runoff, ocean dumpsites, ocean vessels, and the burning of
    fossil fuels are just a few of the pathways that bring toxic substances to
    the oceans.
</p>
<p>
    Toxic compounds enter marine food chains either directly from the water or
    from concentrated deposits in sediments. Organisms accumulate toxic
    substances in their tissues, where they may be passed up the food
    chain.Some of these compounds are concentrated at each step in the chain.
    The ocean’s top predatory fish and marine mammals therefore often have the
    highest concentrations of toxic compounds in their bodies. Killer whales,
    walruses, and tuna are among those most contaminated.
</p>
<p>
    Accumulated toxic substances disrupt hormone cycles, cause birth defects,
    suppress the immune system, and cause disorders resulting in cancer,
    tumors, and genetic abnormalities. In some instances, accumulated toxic
    substances can even cause death in marine animals.
</p>
<p>
    The contamination of certain commercial species may pose particular
problems for humans. Recent studies sponsored by    <em>The Mobile Register </em>indicated that the presence of methylmercury
    (the bio-available form of mercury, and the form most prevalent in fish) in
    several species of fish in the Gulf of Mexico, including ling, amberjack,
    and redfish, may be so great that Food and Drug Administration standards
    would prohibit selling them to the public. In 2001, of the 2,618 fish
    advisories issued in U.S. waters, almost 75 percent were for mercury
    contamination. In Alaska and other polar regions, the evidence of
    correlation between increased toxic loads and declining health in humans
    and animals alike is mounting.
</p>
<p>
    The Arctic and Antarctic are hard hit by certain persistent toxins,
    especially heavy metals and organochlorines, which include PCBs, due to the
    peculiar mechanisms by which these compounds are preferentially transported
    to the polar regions. Airborne toxins are repeatedly deposited and
    volatilized as they are swept by atmospheric circulation from their points
    of origin toward the polar regions. This process is known as the
    grasshopper effect because the substances “hop” from their sources to their
    ultimate repositories in the polar marine environment.
</p>
<p>
    Not enough is being done to address the dangers that toxic substances pose
    to marine species and to humans. There are no water quality standards for
    PAHs under the CWA, no ambient air quality standards for mercury under the
    Clean Air Act (CAA), no systematic monitoring of toxins levels in most
    species consumed by humans, and there is insufficient effort to clean up
    toxic contaminants in sensitive marine environments. These policy
    shortcomings should be addressed without delay.
</p>
<p align="left">
    <strong>CRUISE SHIPS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Cruise ships can offer spectacular views and unparalleled wildlife
    experiences. For many Americans, cruises provide their only exposure to the
    oceans and marine wildlife, and the popularity of this activity is
    increasing. In recent years the cruise ship industry has grown at an
    average annual rate of eight percent, and expansion continues. In 2001, the
    North American cruise industry set a record when it carried 8.4 million
    passengers. In San Francisco Bay, a new cruise terminal is expected to more
    than double the number of ship visits per year. Cruise ships make frequent
    stops in Florida, the Caribbean, along the West Coast, Maine, and Alaska.
</p>
<p>
    While taking a cruise can provide an invaluable experience for passengers,
    cruise ships can pose a particular risk to the very environments they seek
    to explore. With as many as 5,000 people onboard, a cruise ship is akin to
    a floating city, where people go about many of the same activities as they
    do at home: showering, cleaning, cooking. In addition, cruise ships offer
    such amenities as photo developing, hairdressing, and dry cleaning. The
    waste from these activities, however, is not regulated like waste produced
    from cities.
</p>
<p>
    In one week, a typical cruise ship generates 210,000 gallons of black water
    (sewage), 1,000,000 gallons of gray water (shower, sink, dishwashing
    water), 37,000 gallons of oily bilge water, more than eight tons of solid
    waste, millions of gallons of ballast water containing potential invasive
    species, and toxic wastes from dry cleaning and photo processing
    laboratories. This effluent,when discharged untreated—as too often happens—
    delivers human pathogens, nutrients, and hazardous substances directly to
    the marine environment. The wastewater pollution from these ships is
    compounded by air pollution from burning trash and fuel emissions that
    enter the marine environment via atmospheric deposition.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the fact that cruise ships discharge waste from a single source,
    they are exempted from regulation under the CWA point source permitting
    system.
</p>
<p>
    The CWA allows the discharge of untreated black water anywhere beyond three
    miles from shore, and does not require any treatment of gray or ballast
    water. Only in Alaskan waters are cruise ships required to meet federal
    effluent standards; treat gray water discharges; and monitor, record, and
    report discharges to state and federal authorities. In addition, the CWA
    authorizes the U.S. Coast Guard to inspect the discharge logs and pollution
    control equipment aboard ships. However, Coast Guard officers are not
    required to test discharges for
</p>
<p>
    compliance.
</p>
<p>
    The CWA and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships together regulate bilge
    water, which must be run through an oilwater separator before it is
    discharged. The National Invasive Species Act encourages all oceangoing
    vessels to exchange ballast water but does not require them to do so. The
    air emissions from ships are covered under the CAA amendments of 1990, but
    the EPA has yet to impose regulations.
</p>
<p>
    In short, the legal regime that covers cruise ships is complex but not
    comprehensive. Unless we take greater steps to control discharges and
    reduce pollution, we will continue to harm the very places we love to
    visit.

            <strong>INVASIVE SPECIES</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Invasive species—non-native species whose introduction harms or is
            likely to harm the environment, economy, or human health—present
            one of the most significant threats to biodiversity and healthy
            ecosystems. Once introduced, they have the potential to establish
            themselves alongside, or in place of, existing species. They can
            compete with native species for prey and habitat, facilitate the
            spread of diseases, introduce new genetic material, and even alter
            landscapes. Invasive species can impede endangered species
            conservation and restoration efforts. In the marine environment,
            some compete with commercially significant fish species for food
            and habitat, or they clog nets and eat bait. On land and in the
            sea, invasive species are responsible for about 137 billion dollars
            in lost revenue and management costs in the U.S. each year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Invasive species are hard to identify and eradicate before they
            take hold in an ecosystem, which can occur remarkably quickly. For
            example, every 14 weeks, a new invasive species is discovered in
            the San Francisco Bay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ballast water is the primary vector for the release of invasive
            species into marine waters. Ballast water—and all the living
            creatures contained within it—is pumped into and out of oceangoing
            vessels for stabilization. Often it is taken up in one port and
            discharged in another. Every day, some 7,000 species are
            transported around the world via ballast water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another important vector is aquaculture. Species such as Atlantic
            salmon, grown on the western coasts of the U.S. and Canada, act as
            invasive species if they escape or are released unintentionally
            from aquaculture facilities into the surrounding waters. Once in
            the wild, they can compete with native species for food, shelter,
            and other resources, as well as spread disease. In some cases,
            species raised for aquaculture may interbreed with native species,
            potentially threatening the viability of native stocks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other vectors include the home aquarium industry, ship hulls, oil
            platforms, and marine debris. Invasive species arrive in seaweed
            used to pack live bait and via the pet trade industry. They also
            reach U.S. waters as live food imports. The Internet has
            significantly aided the introduction of new species. Today,
            consumers need only a credit card, access to a computer, and a
            delivery address to purchase marine life for food, for use as bait,
            or as pets.
        </p>
        <p>
            In an increasingly global economy, all this mobility represents a
            serious threat to the health of living marine resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our laws are not equipped to deal with these threats. Biological
            pollution by invasive species is the focus of the National Invasive
            Species Act of 1996 (NISA). However, under the NISA structure,
            invasive species are managed on a caseby-case, crisis-by-crisis
            basis, and the national focus is on terrestrial invasive species.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the extent that NISA addresses marine species, it does so almost
            exclusively in the context of ballast-water discharges, despite the
            existence of many other vectors. Ballast-water exchange (BWE) is a
            procedure in which ships in the open ocean dump ballast water taken
            aboard in foreign ports. Its purpose is to lessen the chance of
            introducing coastal invasive species into potentially hospitable
            habitats in destination ports. However, BWE does not always
            dislodge species and it does not apply to coastwise travel, which
            can also allow species to be transported to new environments.
            Additionally, BWE is not mandatory under NISA. Although the U.S.
            Coast Guard is required to check ship logs to determine whether an
            exchange occurred, it is not required to check the ballast tanks.
            Current guidelines encourage ship operators to report voluntary
            exchange, but compliance with this minimal requirement is weak.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is little law focusing on other vectors of invasive species.
            For example, there is no uniform regime in place to track live
            imports either entering or traveling around the country. There is
            no systematic process for determining which management approach is
            best when a species is found, no central source of information for
            researching species, and no dedicated source of funding to control
invasive species. For species like the destructive seaweed,            <em>Caulerpa taxifolia</em>, which grows as much as three inches
            [7.6 cm] a day, any delay in response could have severe
            environmental and economic
        </p>
        <p>
            ramifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, agencies at different levels of government report
            commodities using a different nomenclature and verification system.
            With such inconsistency, neighboring states could simultaneously be
            working to promote and eradicate the same species, and one agency’s
            food list could be another agency’s most wanted list of invaders.
            The lack of regulatory clarity was brought home by the discovery of
            the invasive snakehead fish in a Maryland pond. Federal regulations
            did not prohibit the importation or interstate transportation of
            this Asian fish and state law provided only a mild penalty for
            release of the fish, for which the statute of limitations had
            expired. Furthermore, state managers had no clear legal authority
            to eradicate the population that had established itself. This type
            of confusion results in invasive species—literally— slipping
            through the regulatory cracks and getting into the environment
            without anyone noticing.

            The use of anthropogenic sound as a tool in the ocean has become
            enormously valuable for scientists,engineers,fishermen, and the
            military. It allows fishermen to locate schools of fish and to keep
            predators from raiding or becoming entangled in their nets. The use
            of sound also helps mariners detect icebergs and other
            obstructions, biologists study behavior changes in marine species,
            oceanographers map the bottom of the ocean floor, geologists find
            oil and gas, climatologists research global climate change, and the
            U.S. Navy detect submarines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many marine species, including marine mammals, turtles, and fish,
            also rely on sound. They use vocalizations and their ability to
            hear to detect predators, prey, and each other. In the oceans, as
            on land, sound is essential for communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anthropogenic sound in the ocean is on the rise, mainly due to
            increased vessel traffic. Coastal development is bringing more
            pleasure craft, and globalization and international trade require
            more commercial vessels. In addition, the navies of the United
            States and other nations are increasingly using active sonar
            systems to patrol coastal waters for enemy submarines. Meanwhile,
            oil and gas operations on the outer continental shelf are expected
            to spread into deeper waters. Climate change, too, may have a
            significant effect on sound levels in the ocean. Not only does
            sound travel faster in warmer water, but also rising temperatures
            and melting ice at the poles may open new shipping channels in
            areas that have previously experienced little vessel traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sound sources differ in both their intensity and frequency, and
            thus can have varied effects on species. Sounds in the same
            frequency ranges used by marine species can mask acoustic
            communication among animals and interfere with detection of prey
            and predators. High-intensity sounds can cause pain and, in some
            circumstances, tissue and organ damage. If the pressure resulting
            from the sound is intense enough, the animal can experience
            internal bleeding and subsequent death.
        </p>
        <p>
            A mass stranding of whales in 2000 heightened concerns about the
            effects of sound in the oceans. In March of that year, at least 17
            whales were stranded on beaches in the northern Bahama Islands.
            Most of the animals were alive when they stranded and eight of them
            were returned to the sea. The other nine animals died; pathology
            reports revealed bruising and internal organ damage. The stranding
            occurred about the time that ten U.S. Navy vessels were operating
            their midfrequency sonar systems nearby. Investigations conducted
            cooperatively by the Navy and the National Marine Fisheries Service
            suggested that the sonar transmissions were a critical factor in
            the strandings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Low-intensity sounds can disrupt behavior and cause hearing loss,
            ultimately affecting longevity, growth, and reproduction. Frequent
            or chronic exposure to both high- and low-intensity sounds may
            cause stress, which human and terrestrial animal studies indicate
            can affect growth, reproduction, and ability to resist disease.
            Impulse sounds, such as those produced by explosions and seismic
            air guns, may damage or destroy plankton, including fish eggs and
            larvae, as well as damage or destroy tissues and organs in higher
            vertebrates.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), Endangered Species Act
            (ESA), and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) all provide
            legal mechanisms for addressing sound. However, the MMPA and ESA
            apply only to marine mammals and endangered species, and are only
            capable of protecting individuals from particular sound-related
            projects, such as drilling operations or sonar activities. In
            addition, the federal government has recently proposed to exempt
            certain activities from environmental review under NEPA. Because
            review under these statutes is triggered only on a case-by-case
            basis and does not effectively address cumulative impacts on marine
            ecosystems, underwater sound as a source of potentially significant
            pollution in the marine environment has not received comprehensive
            treatment. A new policy framework is needed to adequately address
            this emerging pollution concern.

            <strong>ACTION TO REDUCE MARINE POLLUTION</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For too long our oceans have been dumping grounds. Within
        </p>
        <p>
            U.S. waters, ecosystems are subjected to insults from nonpoint,
            unregulated point, and nontraditional types of pollution from both
            land- and ocean-based sources. Nutrients, toxins, cruise ship
            discharges, acoustic and biological pollution, and invasive species
            all harm marine ecosystems, and the legal regimes in place do not
            match the nature of today’s pollution threats. For each of these
            pollution sources, policy changes can and should be made as quickly
            as possible.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS</strong>
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>1. </strong>
            <strong>
                Revise, strengthen, and redirect pollution laws to focus on
                nonpoint source pollution on a watershed basis.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            EPA and the states should establish water quality standards for
            nutrients, especially nitrogen, as quickly as possible. EPA and the
            states should also ensure that water quality standards are in place
            for other pollutants—such as PAHs, PCBs, and heavy metals such as
            mercury—where these are identified as problematic on a
            watershed-by-watershed basis. Congress should amend the Clean Water
            Act to require the use of best management practices to control
            polluted runoff resulting from agriculture and development.
            Congress and the executive branch should provide substantial
            financial and technical support for the adoption of such practices.
            Congress should link the receipt of agricultural and other federal
            subsidies to compliance with the Clean Water Act. Finally, Congress
            and the Environmental Protection Agency should ensure that air
            emissions of nitrogen compounds, mercury, and other pollutants are
            reduced to levels that will result in a substantial reduction of
            their impact on marine ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>2. </strong>
            <strong>Address unabated point sources of pollution.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Concentrated animal feeding operations should be brought into
            compliance with existing provisions in the CWA. Congress should
            enact legislation that regulates wastewater discharges from cruise
            ships under the CWA by establishing uniform minimum standards for
            discharges in all state waters and prohibiting discharges within
            the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone that do not meet effluent
            standards. Congress should amend NISA to require ballast-water
            treatment for all vessels that travel in U.S. waters, and regulate
            ballast-water discharge through a permitting system under the CWA.
            Finally, the International Maritime Organization draft convention
            on ballast-water management should be finalized and its provisions
            implemented through appropriate U.S. laws.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>3. </strong>
            <strong>
                Create a flexible framework to address emerging and
                nontraditional sources of pollution.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            A national electronic permitting system should be created under
            NISA to facilitate communication and track imports of live species
            that may result in aquatic introductions. Each state should
            inventory existing species and their historical abundance, in
            conjunction with the development of the regional ocean governance
            plans under the National Ocean Policy Act. Congress should provide
            adequate funding for developing statewide invasive species
            management plans that include provisions for inventorying,
            monitoring, and rapid response. With regard to sound, a
            comprehensive research and monitoring program should be developed
            to determine the effects of sound sources on living marine
            resources and ecosystems. Consideration should be given to
            requiring the utilization of best available control technologies,
            where the generation of sound has potential adverse effects.
            Finally, the environmental ramifications of any sound-producing
            project should be taken into formal consideration—pursuant to NEPA
            or other applicable statutes—at the planning stages of the project,
            before significant resources, time, and money have been devoted to
            its development.

            <strong>4. Strengthen control of toxic pollutants.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The U.S. should ratify the Stockholm Convention on Persistent
            Organic Pollutants (POPs), and implement federal legislation that
            allows for additions to the list of the “dirty dozen” chemicals. In
            concert with this effort, EPA should develop and lead a
            comprehensive monitoring program to quantify levels of particular
            toxic substances in designated ocean habitats and species, and
            sufficient resources should be devoted to studying the effects of
            toxins on marine species. This monitoring program should be
            coordinated with Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and EPA seafood
            contaminant advisory efforts, so that people know where their
            seafood comes from and what it contains.

                            Usually, if you want to go swimming, you probably
                            check the weather report, and not the pollution
                            advisory, for the beach. But things have
                            changed.According to a report released in August
                            2004 by the Natural Resources Defense Council
                            (NRDC), more beach closings and advisory days were
                            posted in 2003 than in any of the previous 14 years
                            that NRDC had been monitoring them. The beaches
                            included in the report are in U.S. coastal areas
                            and on the Great Lakes.The numbers show a 51%
                            increase in closures over 2002.Part of the increase
                            is because of better pollution monitoring programs,
                            but there is no escaping the fact that beaches are
                            under serious threat.

                            The Natural Resources Defense Council is a
                            national, nonprofit organization of scientists,
                            lawyers, and environmental specialists dedicated to
                            protecting public health and the environment. It
                            was founded in 1970.The NRDC press release for its
                            2004 report noted the disturbing finding that local
                            authorities could not identify the pollution
                            sources that caused 68% of the beach closings and
                            pollution advisories. This was the highest rate of
                            “unknown sources” in the 14 years that NRDC has
                            done this survey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The report echoed what other reports have found:
                            Pollution from the runoff of paved surfaces, such
                            as parking lots, roads, and rooftops, is the
                            “largest and fastest growing source of water
                            pollution in coastal waters.” In addition to
                            nonpoint pollution sources, sewage overflows and
                            malfunctioning sewage treatment plants and pump
                            stations pollute coastal waters. Septic systems,
                            boating waste, oil pollution, and waterfowl are
                            other contributing sources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are actions that can be taken on the local,
                            state, and federal levels to address this problem.
                            The public outcry in the early 1970s over filthy
                            lakes and rivers encouraged Congress to pass the
                            Clean Water Act in 1972. Thanks to this historic
                            legislation, there already exists a legal toolbox
                            to begin curbing sources of water pollution. Now it
                            is time to put it to use to take better care of our
                            ocean resources.

            Our nation is blessed with nearly 23,000 miles [37,014 km] of ocean
            shoreline (excluding Alaska), more than 5,500 miles [8,851 km] of
            Great Lakes shoreline, and 300,000 miles [482,803 km] of rivers
            (many of which eventually empty into oceans and bays). Beaches are
            one of America’s favorite vacation destinations. More than 180
            million Americans visit coastal and Great Lakes counties and their
            beaches each year, generating tens of billions of dollars in sales
            of goods and services and supporting tens of millions of jobs.
            According to the April 2004 Preliminary Report by the U.S.
            Commission on Ocean Policy,“[coastal] tourism and recreation
            constitute some of the fastest growing business sectors—enriching
            economies and supporting jobs in communities virtually everywhere
            along the coasts of the continental United States, southeast
            Alaska, Hawaii, and our island territories and commonwealths.”
            While America’s waters are cleaner now than they were 30 years ago
            when rivers were burning and lakes were dying, U.S. coastal waters
            are generally in fair to poor condition. National water-quality
            monitoring data reported by the states in the year 2000, the most
            recent national picture available from the Environmental Protection
            Agency (EPA), show that approximately 45 percent of waters assessed
            by the states are not clean enough to support basic uses such as
            fishing or swimming; i.e., they do not meet water quality
            standards. To make matters worse, our towns and our states do not
            necessarily protect us from swimming-associated diseases, such as
            gastroenteritis, hepatitis, salmonellosis, and other infections and
            viruses.
        </p>
        <p>
            America’s beachgoers should feel confident that a visit to the
            beach will not be followed by a visit to the doctor. We need to
            know that the waters in which we swim, surf, and dive are safe. At
            a minimum, this means that recreational waters must be regularly
            tested, and the results must be measured against effective health
            standards.When waters do not meet these standards, the public needs
            to be promptly and clearly notified.
        </p>
        <p>
            To spotlight this issue, every summer for the past 14 years the
            Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has undertaken a study of
            beach closings/advisories and beachwater monitoring and
            public-notification programs in coastal and Great Lakes states.
            National and local policymakers, reporters, and activists have come
            to rely on NRDC’s <em>Testing the Waters </em>reports for reliable,
            up-to-date information. Our work has triggered significant
            expansion of beachwater monitoring programs across the United
            States and new and emerging laws—particularly the federal BEACH Act
            of 2000, which is better protecting the health of beachgoers. At
            least 12 states initiated or expanded monitoring programs between
            the time NRDC began the report in 1991 and the passage of the BEACH
            [Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health] Act (Alabama,
            California, Florida, Georgia,
        </p>
        <p>
            Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio,
            South Carolina,and Texas).As a result of federal grants now
            available to states through the BEACH Act, virtually every coastal
            and Great Lakes state is in the process of either initiating or
            expanding monitoring and public notification programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            While beaches are better monitored than in the past, that
            monitoring reveals the extent to which sources of beachwater
            pollution remain unaddressed. Closings and advisories continue to
            rise while the sources of that pollution are usually not even
            identified, much less controlled. NRDC is issuing this report—the
            14<sup>th </sup>annual <em>Testing the Waters</em>—as a reminder of
            how unchecked pollution continues to lower Americans’ quality of
            life and threatens public health. This year [2004], as in past
            years, we found that water pollution continues to degrade the
            quality and health of many of our nation’s ocean,bay,Great
            Lakes,and other freshwater beaches. Too often, rainwater turns to
            ruinous water as it washes untreated sewage and other contaminants
            into our oceans, bays, and lakes. Significant stretches of
            coastline are subject to closings or swimming advisories during the
            year. We hope this report spurs Congress, the Environmental
            Protection Agency (EPA), states, and localities to improve
            prevention and control over the sources of coastal pollution and to
            close remaining gaps in monitoring and public notification at our
            nation’s beaches.

            <strong>CHAPTER 1 SOURCES OF BEACHWATER POLLUTION</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Most beach closings and advisories are based on monitoring that
            detects elevated levels of bacteria indicating the presence of
            microscopic disease-causing organisms from human and animal wastes.
            These wastes typically enter coastal waters from discharges of
            untreated or partially treated wastes from sewage treatment plants
            and sanitary sewers (such as combined sewer or sanitary sewer
            overflows), septic system failures, and stormwater runoff from
            urban, suburban, and rural areas. Beach closings and advisories can
            also be responses to other specific pollution events, such as an
            overflow from an animalwaste lagoon or an oil spill. In some
            coastal and Great Lakes counties, advisories are issued as a
            precautionary measure when storms occur because past experience
            demonstrates that rain carries pollution to swimming waters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eighty-eight percent of beach closings/advisories in 2003 were
            based on monitoring that detected bacteria levels exceeding
            beachwater quality standards. Six percent were precautionary due to
            rain that was known to carry pollution into coastal waters, 4
            percent of beach closings and advisories were issued in response to
            a known pollution event (without relying solely on monitoring
            results), and 2 percent were due to other sources, such as dredging
            and algal blooms. The percentages may add up to more than 100
            percent because more than one cause may have contributed to a
            closing or advisory. For example, some closings/advisories begin as
            precautionary measures due to rain or a known contamination event,
            and are then extended because subsequent monitoring reveals
            prolonged elevated bacteria levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major pollution sources, as well as the number of closings and
            advisories in 2003 attributable to these sources, are summarized in
            Table 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sewage overflows from sanitary and combined sewers and
            malfunctioning sewage treatment plants and pump stations have
            always been a major cause of ocean, bay, and Great Lakes beach
            closings and advisories. Today, stormwater runoff from urban,
            suburban, and nonurban areas is also recognized as a significant
            problem, resulting in elevated bacteria levels and increased
            illness rates for swimmers. Almost every coastal and Great Lakes
            state reported having at least one beach where stormwater drains
            onto or near bathing beaches. New Jersey, California, Florida, and
            Connecticut are among the states that reported having numerous
            beaches near stormwater outfalls.

            coastal towns and cities. Coastal population grew by 37 million
            people between 1970 and 2000 and by 2015 is projected to increase
            by another 21 million. As population grows along the U.S. coast,
            sewage systems become more stressed, and impervious surfaces—roofs,
            roads, and parking lots, for example— increase. Unless strong
            measures are taken, sewer overflows and stormwater runoff from
            these rapidly growing areas will increasingly degrade coastal
            waters and pollute our beaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following is a description of the different sources of
            beachwater pollution.

            <strong>COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Combined sewers are pipes designed to carry both raw sewage from
            residences and industrial sites and stormwater runoff from streets
            to sewage treatment plants.When it rains—even as little as
            one-quarter of an inch [just over half a centimeter]—the volume of
            the combined wastewater becomes too great for the treatment plant
            to handle. In such circumstances, the flow is then diverted to
            outfall points that discharge pollutants—including raw sewage;
            floatables such as garbage,syringes,and tampon applicators; toxic
            industrial waste; and contaminated stormwater—into the nearest
            stream or coastal waterway. These untreated discharges can be as
            potent as direct sewer emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) are one of the major causes of
            pathogen contamination in marine and Great Lakes waters near urban
            areas. Although they are most prevalent in urban areas,CSOs occur
            throughout coastal and Great Lakes states. Combined sewer overflows
            also contaminate shellfish waters and recreational beaches.
            Combined sewers serve 40 million people nationwide. Although an EPA
            policy that aims to reduce these overflows has been in effect since
            1994, virtually all combined sewer systems continue to overflow
            when it rains. The EPA 1994 Combined Sewer Overflow Control policy
            required all systems to implement nine minimum system controls by
            1997. According to the EPA’s 2001 Report to Congress, progress has
            been slow. Only 32 percent of CSO communities are implementing the
            nine minimum system controls, despite the January 1997 deadline.
            Only 19 percent have finished their plans for controlling CSOs, and
            fewer than 10 percent have finished implementing CSO controls. The
            EPA estimates that 1,260 billion gallons of raw sewage from CSO
            discharges continue to flow into our surface waters every year.

            <strong>SANITARY SEWER OVERFLOWS AND </strong>
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>SEWER-LINE BREAK DISCHARGES</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Many sanitary sewers—those designed to carry only human and
            industrial waste from buildings to sewage-treatment plants—pose a
            threat to bathing-beach safety. Human-waste sewage lines have
            breaches, obstructions such as tree roots or grease clogs, cracks,
            stormwater drain cross-connections, and open manholes that permit
            infiltration by groundwater and inflows of stormwater. These
            sanitary sewers can become overloaded, especially when it rains,
            and can overflow and discharge raw sewage from manholes, manhole
            bypasses, pump-station bypasses, and treatment-plant bypasses. In
            addition, sanitary-sewer lines are often old and, in many cities,
            inadequately maintained. They can break and spill sewage directly
            onto streets or into waterways. The EPA has estimated 40,000
            sanitary sewer overflows (SSO) annually and about 400,000 basement
            backups. These overflows often discharge sewage, untreated,
            directly into coastal waterways or their tributaries, causing
            between 1.8 and 3.5 million people to get gastroenteritis each year
            from swimming in raw sewage from SSOs. In January 2001, the EPA
            proposed SSO regulations that would require improved capacity,
            operation, and maintenance and require that systems notify the
            public when these overflows occur. Unfortunately, instead of
            finalizing rules to prevent SSOs, the Bush Administration has held
            up these proposed rules.

            To make matters worse, the EPA has recently proposed to allow the
            “blending” of minimally treated sewage with secondarily treated
            effluent during rains. In effect this policy would allow the
            discharge of nearly raw sewage so long as it is sufficiently
            diluted. Analyses of pathogen data from blended sewage discharges
            gathered by the Milwaukee Public Health Department conclude that
            people swimming at the sewage discharge point in Lake Michigan
            would have had a 50 percent chance of contracting giardiasis after
            this blended sewage had been released, representing a thousandfold
            increase in the risk of getting sick as a result of exposure to
            pathogens while swimming.

            <strong>SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT MALFUNCTIONS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sewage plants in coastal areas tend to serve densely populated,
            rapidly growing urban areas. When too many homes and businesses are
            hooked up to a sewage treatment plant, the plant cannot treat the
            sewage adequately. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
            Administration (NOAA) estimates that between 1990 and 2010 the
            coastal population will grow from 112 million to more than 127
            million—an increase of almost 13 percent. Plants that exceed their
            capacity or the capacity of their collection systems are prone to
            more frequent episodes of bypasses and inadequate treatment.
            Moreover, sewage treatment plants can, and often do, malfunction as
            the result of human error, breakage of old equipment, or unusual
            conditions in the raw sewage. At such times, raw or partially
            treated sewage may be discharged into coastal waterways and their
            tributaries. Sewage plants are increasingly discharging
            inadequately treated sewage in high-flow conditions. Instead of
            providing full secondary treatment for sewage, treated and
            untreated sewage are mixed, increasing the pathogen load to
            receiving waters.

            <strong>URBAN STORMWATER RUNOFF</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Stormwater starts as rain or snowmelt. As it washes over roads,
            rooftops, parking lots, construction sites, and industrial or
            commercial sites, it becomes contaminated with oil and grease,
            heavy metals, pesticides, litter, and pollutants from vehicle
            exhaust. On its way to stormdrains, it also often picks up fecal
            matter from dogs, cats, pigeons, other urban animals, and even
            humans. Stormdrains may empty into separate storm sewer systems
            that carry only stormwater and discharge directly into waterways,
            or they may become a part of combined sewer systems, which, as
            described above, usually overflow when it rains. Moreover, human
            waste may find its way into storm sewer systems from adjacent
            sewage pipes that leak or from businesses or residences that are
            illegally hooked up. Illicit discharges may also include such
            substances as oil from cars, paint, and grease from restaurants. In
            Los Angeles County, for instance, the sewer system is separate from
            the stormdrain system, yet Santa Monica Bay stormdrains sometimes
            discharge runoff containing human enteric viruses, indicating the
            presence of human wastes. About a quarter of our nation’s polluted
            estuaries and lakes are fouled by urban stormwater, and it is a
            significant source of bathingbeach pollution in many regions.
            Almost every coastal or Great Lakes state has beaches with
            stormdrains nearby.

            Urban runoff can cause swimmers to become ill. A recent study of
            the health effects of urban runoff compared illness rates for
            surfers in California’s urban North Orange County and rural Santa
            Cruz County during the winters of 1998 and 1999. The study
            determined that surfers at the North Orange County beaches, which
            were more polluted by urban runoff, saw modestly elevated
            incidences of illness in 1999, and twice as many illnesses in 1998
            (likely because 1998 was a wet year associated with El Niño). The
            EPA regulations require cities and industrial and construction
            sites to obtain permits, develop stormwater management plans, and
            implement best management practices; however, only limited progress
            has been made to date. Vigorous implementation and enforcement and
            ambitious pollutant reduction goals are necessary to make this
            program successful. Unfortunately, despite the magnitude of
            stormwater pollution, the EPA recently declined to set baseline
            technology standards for new construction and

            <strong>POLLUTED RUNOFF FROM NONURBAN AREAS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In nonurban and suburban areas, rainwater often flows directly over
            farms, roads, golf courses, and lawns into waterways.
        </p>
        <p>
            Farm runoff may contain high concentrations of pathogenic animal
            waste, fertilizers, and pesticides. Suburban lawn runoff often
            contains significant amounts of animal waste, fertilizer, and other
            chemicals. This uncontrolled runoff can foul beaches in less
            densely populated areas. Animal waste can also contain pathogens
            usually not found in human waste, such as <em>E. coli </em>0157:H7.
            Animal waste from large feedlots, often spread too heavily on
            fields, runs off and has been linked to outbreaks of a toxic
            microorganism, <em>Pfiesteria piscicida</em>, in the Chesapeake Bay
            region and North Carolina, causing numerous waterway closings.

            <strong>SEPTIC SYSTEMS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dwellings built near the coast may be equipped with underground
            septic systems, which, if not sited, built, and maintained
            properly, can leach wastewater into coastal recreational waters.
            Homeowners often do not adequately maintain their septic systems,
            and there is no federal regulatory program to control waste from
            septic systems. Local governments and states rarely inspect septic
            systems sufficiently to prevent such failures. Bathing beaches can
            be contaminated by fecal matter from malfunctioning or overloaded
            septic systems. Runoff can also carry bacteria from failing septic
            systems far from the shore into streams that empty into bays near
            beaches. The EPA estimates that 25 percent of all U.S. dwellings
            use some kind of septic tank or on-site waste disposal system.

            Improperly handled boating wastes can pose a health and aesthetic
            threat to bathing beaches. Elevated concentrations of fecal
            coliform have been found in areas with high boating density.
            Federal law requires boats with onboard toilets either to treat the
            waste (through chemical treatment) before discharging it or to hold
            the waste and later pump it out for treatment at a sewage-treatment
            plant. Many areas lack sufficient pump-out facilities, and
            compliance with the law appears to be poor in many areas.

            <strong>OIL POLLUTION</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Oil reaches the ocean as a result of the production,
            transportation, and use of oil, and even from natural seeps. Oil
            spilled during tanker accidents, pipeline breaks, and refinery
            accidents can foul beaches. Many oils evaporate quickly, creating
            unsafe fumes. Other oils form globules that can float for days and
            wash onto beaches for weeks after a spill. In addition to the
            catastrophic oil spills, there are small oil spills every time it
            rains. Over the course of a year, urban runoff from a city of 5
            million [people] can contain as much oil and grease as a large
            tanker spill. Normal ship operations also frequently cause small
            oil spills. A recent report by the National Research Council states
            that nearly 85 percent of the 29 million gallons of petroleum that
            enter North American ocean waters each year as a result of human
            activities comes from land-based runoff, polluted rivers,
            airplanes, and small boats and jet skis. The report estimated that
            two-stroke outboard motors release between 0.6 and 2.5 million
            gallons of oil and gasoline into U.S. coastal waters each year. Oil
            runoff from cars and trucks is increasing in coastal areas where
            the population is increasing and roads and parking lots are
            expanding to accommodate

            <strong>WATERFOWL</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Several municipalities listed waterfowl as the cause of a beach
            closing or advisory. Large or excessive populations of waterfowl at
            a beach or in suburban areas draining near a beach can occur during
            migration season when other potential waterfowl habitats are
            unavailable for some reason, such as filling of wetlands, or at
            other times as a result of altered ecological conditions (for
            example, when Canada geese that were previously migratory become
            resident). The fecal matter from these waterfowl can sometimes
            overload the normal capacity of a beach to absorb natural wastes,
            degrading water quality.

                            Welcome news is that there is less oil in the sea
                            now than there was in 1985, according to the
                            National Research Council (NRC). Even more
                            compelling is evidence that the largest source of
                            oil in the oceans is not from oil spills, but from
                            nonpoint pollution—what washes off the roads and
                            other paved surfaces, into the storm drains, and
                            into the oceans. This accounts for about 16 million
                            gallons of oil a year washing into U.S. coastal
                            waters.

                            No matter how it gets into the ocean, oil has been
                            an environmental problem for a long time. Large oil
                            tanker spills, like the 10.9 million gallon spill
                            from the ship <em>Exxon Valdez </em>in 1989, kill
                            hundreds of thousands of animals, including fish,
                            birds, and mammals, and ruin thousands of miles of
                            coastline. But the toxic oil, and the toxic
                            compounds created as the oil degrades over time,
                            can remain in the water and sediment for many
                            years. For example, oil from a barge spill 30 years
                            ago is still present just inches below the sediment
                            in some Massachusetts salt marshes. This is a
                            concern because even small amounts of oil can harm
                            marine organisms.

                            As Rabalais’s article notes, the threat of oil in
                            the oceans must be minimized by reducing spills and
                            by decreasing the inputs from nonpoint sources. The
                            author cites the need for regulatory and safety
                            measures to address the potential spills from aging

                            issue of nonpoint sources, the author says that
                            federal, state, and local partnerships are needed
                            to monitor the release of pollutants. And finally,
                            she notes that “since we are all in this together,”
                            we must look toward energy solutions that promote
                            conservation, not waste, of the resource.

            “When it rains, it pours”—or so a motorist caught in a sudden storm
            might think while sliding into another vehicle. It is not merely
            the reduced visibility and the frenetic behavior of drivers in the
            rain that foster such mishaps; the streets also are slicker just
            after the rain begins to fall.Why? Because the oil and grease that
            are dripped, spewed, or otherwise inadvertently deposited by motor
            vehicles onto roadways are among the first materials to be lifted
            off by the rain, thereby literally lubricating the surface. Nor do
            matters end with making life miserable for motorists. The oil and
            grease washed off roads will most likely run into storm sewers and
            be discharged into the nearest body of water. From there, the oily
            materials often are carried to the sea, where they can cause a host
            of environmental problems.

            These events on a rainy day in the city illustrate an important but
            often overlooked route by which petroleum finds its way into
            coastal waters. Shutting down this and other routes presents a
            pressing challenge. True, the nation is doing a better job than
            ever of keeping oil out of the marine environment. But much work
            remains. We need to better understand the various pathways by which
            oil gets into the environment, how it behaves when it gets there,
            what effects it has on living organisms, and, perhaps most
            important, what steps can be taken to further reduce the amount of
            petroleum that enters the nation’s and the world’s oceans.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>SOURCES AND PROBLEMS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Approximately 75 million gallons of petroleum find their way into
North America’s oceans each year, according to            <em>Oil in the Sea III: Inputs, Fates, and Effects</em>, a report
            issued in 2002 by the National Research Council (NRC). About 62
            percent of the total—roughly 47 million gallons per year—derives
            naturally from out of the ocean floor. The rest comes from human
            activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Contrary to common belief, the bulk of human-related inputs is not
            due to large-scale spills and accidents that occur during the
            transport of crude oil or petroleum products. Indeed, these types
            of releases account for only about 10 percent of the oil that
            reaches the sea as a result of human activity. The other 90 percent
            comes in the form of chronic low-level releases associated with the
            extraction and consumption of petroleum. Within this category, the
            biggest problem is nonpoint source pollution. Rivers and streams
            that receive runoff from a variety of land-based activities deliver
            roughly 16 million gallons of oil to North American coastal waters
            each year, more than half of the total anthropogenic load. The
            loads are most obvious in watersheds that drain heavily populated
            areas. Other sources of oil that turns up in the marine environment
            include jettisoned aircraft fuel, marine recreational vehicles, and
            operational discharges, such as cargo washings and releases from
            petroleum extraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is at least some good news. Less oil is now entering the
            oceans as compared to the levels found in a previous NRC report
            issued in 1985. Some of this change may be attributable to
            differences between methodologies used in the two reports, but some
            decreases are due to improved regulations regarding how oil is
            produced and shipped. Spills from vessels in North American waters
            from 1990 through 1999 were down by nearly two-thirds compared to
            the prior decade. There also has been a dramatic decline in the
            amount of oil released into the environment during exploration for
            and production of petroleum and natural gas. Still, the recent NRC
            report concludes that despite such progress, the damage from oil in
            the marine environment is considerably more pervasive and
            longer-term than was previously understood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oil in the sea, whether from catastrophic spills or chronic
            releases, poses a range of environmental problems. Major spills
            receive considerable public attention because of the obvious
            attendant environmental damage, including oil-coated shorelines and
            dead or moribund wildlife, especially among seabirds and marine
            mammals. The largest oil spill in U.S. waters occurred on March 24,
            1989, when the tanker <em>Exxon Valdez</em>, en route from Valdez,
            Alaska, to Los Angeles, California, ran aground on Bligh Reef in
            Prince William Sound, Alaska. Within six hours of the grounding,
            the ship spilled approximately 10.9 million gallons of crude oil,
            which would eventually affect more than 1,100 miles [1,770 km] of
            coastline. Large numbers of animals were killed directly, including
            an estimated 900 bald eagles, 250,000 seabirds, 2,800 sea otters,
            and 300 harbor seals.

            Oil pollution also can have more subtle biological effects, caused
            by the toxicity of many of the compounds contained in petroleum or
            by the toxicity of compounds that form as the petroleum degrades
            over time. These effects may be of short duration and limited
            impact, or they may span long periods and affect entire populations
            or communities of organisms, depending on the timing and duration
            of the spill and the numbers and types of organisms exposed to the
            oil.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, oil spills need not be large to be hazardous to marine
            life. Even a small spill in an ecologically sensitive area can
            result in damage to individual organisms or entire populations.A
            spill’s influence also depends on the type and amount of toxins
            present in the petroleum product released. For instance, the fuel
            oil leaked when the tanker <em>Prestige </em>broke apart off the
            northwest coast of Spain in 2002 was initially more toxic than the
            crude oil spilled from the <em>Exxon Valdez</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            One major problem with all spills, no matter their size or type, is
            that the oil can remain in the environment for a long time. Several
            lines of evidence point to continued exposure of marine organisms
            to oil spilled by the <em>Exxon Valdez</em>. Substantial subsurface
            oil beneath coarse beaches in the spill area was found in the
            summer of 2001. The oil was still toxic and appeared to be
            chemically unchanged since its release more than a decade earlier.
            Some researchers predict that oil beneath mussel beds in the region
            affected by the spill may not decline to background levels for at
            least another two decades. In another instance, scientists studying
            salt marshes in Massachusetts that had been covered by fuel oil
            spilled from the barge <em>Florida </em>30 years ago recently
            reported that oil is still present in sediments at depths of 6 to
            28 centimeters [2.4 to 11 inches]. Moreover, the concentrations of
            oil found in the sediments are similar to those observed shortly
            after the spill. The researchers, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic
            Institution, predict that the compounds may remain there
            indefinitely, while crabs and other intertidal organisms continue
            to burrow through the oil-contaminated layer.

            Reducing the threat of oil in the oceans will require blocking the
            routes by which oil enters the environment. Focusing on inputs from
            spills and nonpoint sources, two of the major anthropogenic
            contributors, will show the range of actions needed.

            <strong>Reducing Spills</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Worldwide, large spills resulting from tanker accidents are down
            considerably from the totals reported by the NRC in 1985—they have
            decreased to 17 million gallons annually from 140 million gallons
            annually. This gain was achieved even as the size of the global
            tanker fleet increased by 900 vessels, to a total of 7,270 in 1999.
            Progress was made through the implementation of numerous
            regulations and by technological advances in vessel construction,
            including the increased use of double-hull tankers, the use of new
            construction materials, and improvements in vessel design. Spills
            larger than 50,000 gallons now represent less than 1 percent of
            total spills by number but are responsible for more than 80 percent
            of the total spill volume. It is important to note, however, that
            more than half of all tanker spills now occur in North American
            waters. Although the number and size of spills in these waters have
            been reduced considerably during the past two decades, with total
            volume falling to 2.5 million gallons per year, they remain the
            dominant domestic source of oil input to the marine environment
            from petroleum transportation activities, as they are globally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prevention, in the form of stricter regulations for tankers, has
            obviously not prevented all large spills, as the <em>Prestige </em>
            spill so dramatically illustrated. Irreparably damaged by a storm,
            the ship spilled nearly 3 million gallons of fuel oil, which spread
            over 125 miles [201 km] of coastline in one of Spain’s leading
            areas of commercial fishing and shellfishing. But out of this
            calamity may come improved policies. The spill has highlighted
            concerns about older, single-hull ships (the <em>Prestige </em>was
            26 years old) that are due to be phased out by 2015, and about what
            Europe should do to keep these ships safe and inspected in the
            meantime. Under a proposal made by the European Commission in
            December 2002, which the European Union (EU) is expected to adopt,
            single-hull oil tankers will not be allowed to carry heavy grades
            of oil in EU waters. Prohibited grades will include heavy fuel oil,
            heavy crude oil, waste oils, bitumen, and tar. Questions also have
            been raised about singlehull ships that are bypassing EU ports in
            order to avoid tough new EU-mandated inspection rules adopted in
            1999 after the <em>Erika </em>oil spill polluted 250 miles [402 km]
            of French shoreline. The EU regulations before the passage of the
            latest restrictions on transport in EU waters required port
            authorities to check at least 25 percent of all ships coming into
            dock, starting with older, single-hull vessels, with priority going
            to ships flying flags of convenience or registered in countries
            with lax safety, labor, or tax rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            The potential for a large tanker spill, however, is still
            significant, especially in regions without stringent safety
            procedures and maritime inspection practices. Furthermore, tanker
            traffic is expected to grow over the coming decades, as the centers
            of oil production continue to migrate toward the Middle East,
            Russia, and former Soviet states. U.S. agencies should expand their
            efforts to work with ship owners, domestically and internationally,
            through the International Maritime Organization, to enforce and
            build on the international regulatory standards that have
            contributed to the recent decline in oil spills and operational
            discharges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tankers are not the only potential source of large spills. There
            also is concern about aging oil pipelines and other coastal
            facilities. The aging of the infrastructure in fields in the
            central and western Gulf of Mexico and in some areas of Alaska is
            especially disconcerting, because these facilities often lie near
            sensitive coastal areas. Many pipelines in coastal Louisiana that
            should be buried no longer are. Numerous wellheads and other
            facilities within the estuaries are being abandoned, as one company
            takes over facilities from another. As the resources become
            depleted, the cost of extraction exceeds the profit to be gained
            from sale of the product, and owners file bankruptcy and abandon
            holdings. Federal agencies should work with state environmental
            agencies and industry to evaluate the threat posed by aging
            pipelines and abandoned facilities, and to take steps to minimize
            the potential for spills.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong>Reducing Nonpoint Source Inputs</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Regulations developed under the Clean Water Act of 1972 have
            significantly reduced the number and amount of pollutants coming
            from the end of a pipe, and the Toxics Release Inventory tracks
            many of the pollutants that are released. But the more diffuse
            sources, such as urban runoff, atmospheric deposition, and
            watershed drainage, are not regulated or even monitored adequately.
            Unfortunately, nonpoint source runoff is difficult to measure and
            sparsely sampled; as a result, estimates have a high degree of
            uncertainty. Clearly, new federal, state, and local partnerships
            are needed to monitor runoff and to keep better track of how much
            petroleum and other pollutants industry and consumers are
            releasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such a call for increased monitoring will undoubtedly elicit groans
            from managers and other people responsible for water quality, yet
            few people would argue that existing efforts are adequate for the
            overall task. Even the better-funded federal efforts are
            insufficient. The National Stream Quality Accounting Network, the
            national network operated by the U.S. Geological Survey to monitor
            water quality in streams, has increasingly fewer stations,
            particularly along the coast, as budgets are tightened and
            tightened again. Additional funding is necessary to invigorate this
            program. Coastal stations that have been shut down need to be
            restored, and new stations along the coast and at critical inland
            locations need to be added. The network also must expand monitoring
            to include total hydrocarbons (instead of merely “oil and grease,”
            as is now the case), as well as a particular class of compounds
            called polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Growing evidence
            indicates that even at very low concentrations, PAHs carried in
            crude oil or refined products can have adverse effects on biota.
            This suggests that PAHs released from chronic sources may be of
            greater concern than previously recognized, and that in some
            instances the effects of petroleum spills may last longer than
            expected.
        </p>
        <p>
            There also is a great need for expanded basic research. The most
            significant unanswered questions remain those regarding the effects
            on ecosystems of long-term, chronic, low-level exposures resulting
            from petroleum discharges and spills caused by development
            activities. Federal agencies, especially the Environmental
            Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the
            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, should work with
            academia and industry to develop and implement a major research
            effort to more fully understand and evaluate the risk posed to
            organisms and the marine environment by the chronic release of
            petroleum, especially the cumulative effects of chronic releases
            and multiple types of hydrocarbons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apace with advances in monitoring and research, positive steps can
            be taken to implement proven methods for reducing nonpoint source
            discharges of oil into the environment. Remember, for example, the
            motorist brought low by slick pavement. The oil and grease that
            wash off highways during rain storms usually bypass sewage
            treatment plants in storm water overflow systems that pump the rain
            and any materials caught up in the flow directly to the closest
            body of water. In many urban settings, this source can be a
            significant contribution of petroleum to the ocean. As the
            population of coastal regions increases, urban runoff will become
            more polluted because of the expansion in the numbers of cars,
            asphalt-covered highways and parking lots, municipal wastewater
            loads, and the use and improper disposal of petroleum products.
            Collection and treatment of storm water overflows is necessary to
            control these inputs. Improved landscape management and urban
            management, increasing use of fuelefficient vehicles, and public
            education can all contribute to lessening petroleum runoff.
        </p>
        <p>
            The power of public education can be seen in the Chesapeake Bay
            region. In small but effective ways, people living within the bay’s
            watershed are reminded daily of their consumptive uses of
            pollutants that enter the water. They see license plates that
            proclaim “Save the Bay” and storm water drain covers that say
            “Don’t Dump. Drains to Chesapeake Bay.” Education is a first step
            for a better-informed public that will recognize the need for less
            consumption, less pollution, and better conservation of resources.
            This knowledge should but does not always lead to legislation and
            funding for reducing pollutant loads, including oil reaching the
            sea.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional remedial actions should target the recreational
            watercraft that have grown so popular during the past two decades.
            Most of these craft, including jet skis and small boats with
            outboard motors, use two-stroke engines, which release up to 30
            percent of their fuel directly into the water. Collectively, these
            watercraft contribute almost 1 million gallons of petroleum each
            year into North American waters. The bulk of their input is in the
            form of gasoline, which is thought to evaporate rapidly from the
            water surface. However, little is known about the actual fate of
            the discharge, or about its biological effects while in its
            volatile phase, which is highly toxic. In 1990, heightened
            awareness of this problem led the EPA to begin regulating the
            “nonroad engine” population, under the authority of the Clean Air
            Act. Questions remain regarding the amount of petroleum residing in
            the water column or along the surface for biologically significant
            lengths of time. The EPA should continue its phase-out efforts
            directed at two-stroke engines, and it should expand research, in
            conjunction with other relevant federal agencies, on the fate and
            effects of discharges from these older, inefficient motors.
        </p>
        <p>
            To achieve maximal effectiveness, efforts to understand and
            minimize oil pollution should pay heed to worldwide needs. The
            United States and other developed countries have invested much in
            technologies to reduce the spillage of oil into the marine
            environment, as well as in the science that has increased knowledge
            of the effects of spilled oil, either acute or chronic. This
            knowledge should be transferred to people in other countries that
            are developing their petroleum reserves.It is imperative that the
            petroleum industry not simply comply with regulations in developing
            countries where they operate, but that they transfer the knowledge
            derived from extensive studies in U.S. waters to areas where their
            operations are expanding.

        <p align="left">
            <strong>SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is tempting to blame the oil and shipping industries alone for
spills such as those from the <em>Exxon Valdez </em>and the            <em>Prestige</em>, but everyone who benefits from oil bears
            responsibility for the fraction that enters the sea. If companies
            have failed to build and buy double-hull tankers, it is in part
            because consumers do not wish to pay the increased fuel prices that
            would be needed to offset the extra cost. The push for improved
            methods of extracting, producing, and transporting oil must come
            from the general public, and this link reinforces the need for
            education.
        </p>
        <p>
            The price of oil and natural gas is a major force in the world
            economy. As recently as the late 1990s, the average price of a
            barrel of crude oil was less than the cost of a takeout dinner. Yet
            a fluctuation of 20 or 30 percent in the price can influence
            automotive sales, travel decisions, interest rates, stock market
            trends, and the gross national products of industrialized nations.
            Perceived or real decreases in the availability of oil led to long
            lines for gasoline in the early 1970s and to the development and
            sale of fuel-efficient vehicles. Many observers argue that the low
            oil prices in recent years have helped put a glut of gas-guzzling
            vehicles on the highway.As the prices of a barrel of oil and a
            gallon of gasoline continue to rise in the face of social unrest in
            South America and the unrelenting hostilities in the Middle East,
            the value of this limited commodity may become more apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
            The United States needs an energy policy that treats petroleum as a
            limited and treasured commodity that encourages conservation rather
            than waste, and that supports alternative energy development and
            use. The nation also should tighten controls on air and water
            pollution and should adequately fund environmental monitoring of
            water resources. Without these policy changes, U.S. citizens cannot
            expect wise and environmentally sound use of the nation’s or the
            world’s resources. And if U.S. citizens cannot reduce their overly
            consumptive use of petroleum to help in curbing its introduction to
            the diffuse but voluminous nonpoint source pollutant load, how can
            they expect citizens of developing countries to strive for less
            polluting and consumptive actions in the face of an improving
            economy derived from sales of petroleum?

                            fact presents is that bacteria cannot degrade or
                            decompose plastics. Most plastics are
                            photodegradable, meaning that they break down only
                            in the presence of light.The author of the

                            the ocean currents. Plastic is ingested by
                            organisms, and it kills them. For example, sea
                            turtles often eat plastic bags, thinking they are
                            jellyfish. Or animals may strangle in plastic
                            materials. But there is another problem that we

                            plastic polymers absorb and concentrate toxic
                            chemicals. So as plastics degrade further and
                            travel through ocean waters, they spread toxins.
                            These toxins are eaten by plankton, which is in
                            turn eaten by small fish, which are eaten by larger
                            fish, mammals, and birds. In this way, the toxins
                            become concentrated in larger animals. The problem
                            is no longer just having unsightly plastic garbage
                            floating in the middle of the ocean. The problem is
                            the harm being done to fish, birds, mammals, and
                            other creatures of the sea.

                            The research conducted by Charles Moore and the
                            scientific groups with which he works is extremely
                            important because it provides data that can be used
                            by policymakers who are concerned with protecting
ocean resources.The author is captain of the                            <em>Alguita</em>, an independent oceanographic

            It was on our way home,after finishing the Los Angeles-to-Hawaii
            sail race known as the Transpac, that my crew and I first caught
            sight of the trash,floating in one of the most remote regions of
all the oceans.I had entered my cutter-rigged research vessel,            <em>Alguita</em>, an aluminum-hulled catamaran, in the race to test
            a new mast. Although <em>Alguita </em>was built for research
            trawling, she was also a smart sailor, and she fit into the
            “cruising class”of boats that regularly enter the race. We did
            well, hitting a top speed of twenty knots under sail and winning a
            trophy for finishing in third place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the race our strategy, like that of every other boat in
            the race, had been mainly to avoid the North Pacific subtropical
            gyre—the great high-pressure system in the central Pacific Ocean
            that, most of the time, is centered just north of the racecourse
            and halfway between Hawaii and the mainland. But after our success
            with the race we were feeling mellow and unhurried, and our vessel
            was equipped with auxiliary twin diesels and carried an extra
            supply of fuel. So on the way back to our home port in Long Beach,
            California, we decided to take a shortcut through the gyre, which
            few seafarers ever cross. Fishermen shun it because its waters lack
            the nutrients to support an abundant catch. Sailors dodge it
            because it lacks the wind to propel their sailboats.
        </p>
        <p>
            I often struggle to find words that will communicate the vastness
            of the Pacific Ocean to people who have never been to sea. Day
            after day, <em>Alguita </em>was the only vehicle on a highway
            without landmarks, stretching from horizon to horizon. Yet as I
            gazed from the deck at the surface of what ought to have been a
            pristine ocean, I was confronted, as far as the eye could see, with
            the sight of plastic.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seemed unbelievable, but I never found a clear spot. In the week
            it took to cross the subtropical high, no matter what time of day I
            looked, plastic debris was floating everywhere: bottles, bottle
            caps, wrappers, fragments. Months later, after I discussed what I
            had seen with the oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer, perhaps the
            world’s leading expert on flotsam, he began referring to the area
            as the “eastern garbage patch.” But “patch” doesn’t begin to convey
            the reality. Ebbesmeyer has estimated that the area, nearly covered
            with floating plastic debris, is roughly the size of Texas.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interest in marine debris did not begin with my crossing of the
            North Pacific subtropical gyre. Voyaging in the Pacific has been
            part of my life since earliest childhood. In fifty-odd years as a
            deckhand, stock tender, able seaman, and now captain, I became
            increasingly alarmed by the growth in plastic debris I was seeing.
            But the floating plastics in the gyre galvanized my interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did a quick calculation, estimating the debris at half a pound
            for every hundred square meters of sea surface. Multiplied by the
            circular area defined by our roughly thousand-mile course through
            the gyre, the weight of the debris was about 3 million tons,
            comparable to a year’s deposition at Puente Hills, Los Angeles’s
            largest landfill. I resolved to return someday to test my alarming
            estimate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Historically, the kind of drastic accumulation I encountered is a
            brand-new kind of despoilment. Trash has always been tossed into
            the seas, but it has been broken down in a fairly short time into
            carbon dioxide and water by marine microorganisms. Now, however, in
            the quest for lightweight but durable means of storing goods, we
            have created a class of products—plastics— that defeat even the
            most creative and voracious bacteria.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many discarded materials, most plastics in common use do not
            biodegrade. Instead they “photodegrade,” a process whereby sunlight
            breaks them into progressively smaller pieces, all of which are
            still plastic polymers. In fact, the degradation eventually yields
            individual molecules of plastic, but these are still too tough for
            most anything—even such indiscriminate consumers as bacteria—to
            digest. And for the past fifty years or so, plastics that have made
            their way into the Pacific Ocean have been fragmenting and
            accumulating as a kind of swirling sewer in the North Pacific
            subtropical gyre.
        </p>
        <p>
            It surprised me that the debris problem in the gyre had not already
            been looked at more closely by the scientific community. In fact,
            only recently—starting in the early 1990s—has the scientific
            community begun to focus attention on the trash in the gyre. One of
            the first investigators to study the problem was W. James Ingraham
            Jr., an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
            Administration (NOAA) in Seattle. Ingraham’s Ocean Surface Current
            Simulator (OSCURS) predicts that objects reaching this area might
            revolve around in it for sixteen years or more.
        </p>
        <p>
            A year after my sobering voyage, I asked Steven B. Weisberg,
            director of the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project
            and an expert in marine environmental monitoring, to help me make a
            more rigorous estimate of the extent of the debris in the
            subtropical gyre. Weisberg’s group had already published an article
            on the debris they had collected in fish trawls of the Southern
            California Bight, a region along the Pacific coast extending a
            hundred miles both north and south of Los Angeles. As I discussed
            the design plan for our survey with Weisberg’s statisticians, Molly
            K. Leecaster and Shelly L. Moore, it became apparent that we were
            facing a new problem. In the coastal ocean, bodies of water are
            naturally defined, in part, by the coasts they lie against. In the
            open ocean, however, bodies of water are bounded by atmospheric
            pressure systems and the currents those systems create. In other
            words, air, not land, defines the body of water. Because air
            pressure systems move, the body of water we wanted to survey would
            be moving as well. A random sample of a moving area such as the
            gyre would have to be done quite differently from the way
            Weisberg’s group had conducted their survey along the Pacific
            coast.
        </p>
        <p>
            The gyre we planned to survey is one of the largest ocean realms on
            Earth, and one of five major subtropical gyres on the planet. Each
            subtropical gyre is created by mountainous flows of air moving from
            the tropics toward the polar regions. The air in the North Pacific
            subtropical gyre is heated at the equator and rises high into the
            atmosphere because of its buoyancy in cooler, surrounding air
            masses. The rotation of the Earth on its axis moves the heated air
            mass westward as it rises, then eastward once it cools and descends
            at around 30 degrees north latitude, creating a huge,
            clockwise-rotating mass of air.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rotating air mass creates a high-pressure system throughout the
            region. Those high pressures depress the ocean surface, and the
            rotating air mass also drives a slow but oceanicscale surface
            current that moves with the air in a clockwise spiral. Winds near
            the center of the high are light or even calm, and so they do not
            mix the floating debris into the water column. This huge region,
            what I call a “gentle maelstrom,” has become an accumulator of
            debris from innumerable sources along the North Pacific rim, as
            well as from ships at sea.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subtropical gyres are also oceanic deserts—in fact, many of the
            world’s land-based deserts lie at nearly the same latitudes as the
            oceanic gyres. Like their terrestrial counterparts, the oceanic
            deserts are low in biomass. On land the low biomass is caused by
            the lack of moisture; in oceanic deserts the low biomass is a
            consequence of great ocean depths.
        </p>
        <p>
            In coastal areas and shallow seas, winds and waves constantly stir
            up and recycle nutrients, increasing the biomass of the food web.
            In the deep oceans, though, such forces have no effect; the bottom
            sequesters the nutrient-rich residue of millions of years of
            near-surface photosynthetic production, as well as the decomposed
            fragments of life in the sea, trapping them miles below the
            surface. Hence the major source of food for the web of life in deep
            ocean areas is photosynthesis.
        </p>
        <p>
            But even in the clear waters that prevail in the subtropical gyres,
            photosynthesis is confined to the top of the water column. Sunlight
            attenuates rapidly with depth, and by the time it has gone only
            about 5 percent of the way to the bottom, the light is too weak to
            fuel marine plants. The net effect is a vast area poor in
            resources, an effect that makes itself felt throughout the food
            web. Top predators such as tuna and other commercially viable fish
            don’t hang out in the gyres because the density of prey is so low.
            The human predator stays away too: the resources that have drawn
            entrepreneurs and scientists alike to various regions of the ocean
            are not present in the subtropical gyres.
        </p>
        <p>
            What does exist in the gyres is a great variety of filter-feeding
            organisms that prey on the ever-renewed crop of tiny plants, or
            phytoplankton. Each day the phytoplankton grow in the sunlit part
            of the water, and each night they are consumed by the filter
            feeders, a fantastic array of alien-looking animals called
            zooplankton. The zooplankton include chordate jellyfishes known as
            “salps,” which are among the fastest-growing multicellular
            organisms on the planet. By fashioning their bodies into pulsating
            tubes, the salps are able, each day, to filter half the water
            column they inhabit, drawing out the phytoplankton and smaller
            zooplankton for food. But salps are gelatinous creatures with a low
            biomass, and so there is no market for them, either. Hence the
            realm they dominate, one of the largest uniform habitats on the
            planet, remains unexploited and largely unexplored.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leecaster, Moore, and I came up with a plan to make a series of
            trawls with a surface plankton net, along paths within a circle
            with a 564-mile [908-km] radius. The area of the circle would then
be almost exactly 1 million square miles [2.6 million km            <sup>2</sup>]. Trawling would start when we estimated we were under
            the central pressure cell of the high-pressure system that creates
            the gyre.We would regard the starting point as the easternmost
            point along the circumference of the circle.Then we would proceed
            due west to the center of the circle, turn south, and sail back to
            the southernmost point on the circumference, alternating between
            trawling and cruising. We intended to obtain transect samples with
            random lengths and random spacing between trawls. To be
            conservative about our sampling technique, we decided that any
            debris we collected would count only as a sample of the debris
            within the area of the transected circle.
        </p>
        <p>
            In August 1998 I set out with a four-member volunteer crew from
            Point Conception, California heading northwest toward the
            subtropical gyre. Onboard <em>Alguita </em>was a manta trawl, an
            apparatus resembling a manta ray with wings and a broad mouth,
            which skimmed the ocean surface trailing a net with a fine mesh.
            Eight days out of port, the wind dropped below ten knots and we
            decided to practice our manta trawling technique, taking a sample
            at the edge of the subtropical gyre, about 800 miles [1,288 km]
            offshore. We pulled in the manta after trawling three and a half
            miles [5.6 km].
        </p>
        <p>
            What we saw amazed us. We were looking at a rich broth of minute
            sea creatures mixed with hundreds of colored plastic fragments—a
            plastic-plankton soup. The easy pickings energized all of us, and
            soon we began sampling in earnest. Because plankton move up and
            down in the water column each day, we needed to trawl nonstop, day
            and night, to get representative samples. When we encountered the
            light winds typical of the subtropical gyre, we deployed the manta
            outside the port wake, along with two other kinds of nets. Each net
            caught plenty of debris, but far and away the most productive trawl
            was the manta.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was plenty of larger debris in our path as well, which the
            crew members retrieved with an inflatable dingy. In the end, we
            took about a ton of this debris on board. The items included
        </p>
        <p>
            • a drum of hazardous chemicals;
        </p>
        <p>
            • an inflated volleyball, half covered in gooseneck barnacles;
        </p>
        <p>
            • a plastic coat hanger with a swivel hook;
        </p>
        <p>
            • a cathode-ray tube for a nineteen-inch TV;
        </p>
        <p>
            • an inflated truck tire mounted on a steel rim;
        </p>
        <p>
            • numerous plastic, and some glass, fishing floats;
        </p>
        <p>
            • a gallon bleach bottle that was so brittle it crumbled in our
            hands; and
        </p>
        <p>
            • a menacing medusa of tangled net lines and hawsers that we hung
            from the A-frame of our catamaran and named Polly P, for the
            polypropylene lines that made up its bulk.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2001, in the <em>Marine Pollution Bulletin</em>, we published
            the results of our survey and the analysis we had made of the
            debris, reporting, among other things, that there are six pounds
            [2.7 kg] of plastic floating in the North Pacific subtropical gyre
            for every pound of naturally occurring zooplankton. Our readers
            were as shocked as we were when we saw the yield of our first
            trawl. Since then we have returned to the area twice to continue
            documenting the phenomenon. During the latest trip, in the summer
            of 2002, our photographers captured underwater images of jellyfish
            hopelessly entangled in frayed lines, and transparent filter
            feeding organisms with colored plastic fragments in their bellies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Entanglement and indigestion, however, are not the worst problems
            caused by the ubiquitous plastic pollution. Hideshige Takada, an
            environmental geochemist at Tokyo University, and his colleagues
            have discovered that floating plastic fragments accumulate
            hydrophobic—that is, non-water-soluble—toxic chemicals. Plastic
            polymers, it turns out, are sponges for DDT, PCBs, and other oily
            pollutants. The Japanese investigators found that plastic resin
            pellets concentrate such poisons to levels as high as a million
            times their concentrations in the water as free-floating
            substances.
        </p>
        <p>
            The potential scope of the problem is staggering. Every year some
            5.5 quadrillion (5.5 x 1015) plastic pellets—about 250 billion
            pounds of them—are produced worldwide for use in the manufacture of
            plastic products. When those pellets or products degrade, break
            into fragments, and disperse, the pieces may also become
            concentrators and transporters of toxic chemicals in the marine
            environment. Thus an astronomical number of vectors for some of the
            most toxic pollutants known are being released into an ecosystem
            dominated by the most efficient natural vacuum cleaners nature ever
            invented: the jellies and salps living in the ocean. After those
            organisms ingest the toxins, they are eaten in turn by fish, and so
            the poisons pass into the food web that leads, in some cases, to
            human beings. Farmers can grow pesticide-free organic produce, but
            can nature still produce a pollutant-free organic fish? After what
            I have seen firsthand in the Pacific, I have my doubts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many people have seen photographs of seals trapped in nets or
            choked by plastic six-pack rings, or sea turtles feeding on plastic
            shopping bags, but the poster child for the consumption of pelagic
            plastic debris has to be the Laysan albatross. The plastic gadgets
            one typically finds in the stomach of the bird— whose range
            encompasses the remote, virtually uninhabited region around the
            northwest Hawaiian Islands—could stock the checkout counter at a
            convenience store. My analysis of the stomach contents of birds
            from two colonies of Laysan albatrosses that nest and feed in
            divergent areas of the North Pacific show differences in the types
            of plastic they eat. I believe those differences reveal something
            about the way plastic is transported and breaks down in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Midway Island in the Hawaiian chain, a bolus, or mass of chewed
            food, coughed up by one bird included many identifiable objects. By
            contrast, a bird on Guadalupe Island, which lies 150 miles [241 km]
            off the coast of Baja California, produced a bolus containing only
            plastic fragments. The principal natural prey of both bird colonies
is squid,but as the ecologist Carl Safina notes in his book            <em>Eye of the Albatross</em>, the birds’ foraging style can be
            described as “better full than fussy.” Robert W. Henry III, a
            biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and his
            colleagues have tracked both the Hawaiian and the Guadalupe
            populations of birds and found that the foraging areas of each
            colony in the Pacific are generally nonoverlapping and wide apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            One difference between the two areas is apparently the way debris
            flows into them. In Ingraham’s OSCURS model, debris from the coast
            of Japan reaches the foraging area of the Hawaiian birds within a
            year. Debris from the West Coast of the United States, however,
            sticks close to the coast until it bypasses the foraging area of
            the Guadalupe birds, then heads westward to Asia, not to return for
            six years or more. The lengthy passage seems to give the plastic
            debris time to break into fragments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The subtropical gyres of the world are part of the deep ocean
            realm, whose ability to absorb, hide, and recycle refuse has long
            been seen as limitless. That ecologically sound image, however, was
            born in an era devoid of petroleum-based plastic polymers. Yet the
            many benefits of modern society’s productivity have made nearly all
            of us hopelessly, and to a large degree rationally, addicted to
            plastic. Many, if not most, of the products we use daily contain or
            are contained by plastic. Plastic wraps, packaging, and even
            clothing defeat air and moisture and so defeat bacterial and
            oxidative decay. Plastic is ubiquitous precisely because it is so
            good at preventing nature from robbing us of our hard-earned goods
            through incessant decay.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the plastic polymers commonly used in consumer products, even
            as single molecules of plastic, are indigestible by any known
            organism. Even those single molecules must be further degraded by
            sunlight or slow oxidative breakdown before their constituents can
            be recycled into the building blocks of life. There is no data on
            how long such recycling takes in the ocean—some ecologists have
            made estimates of 500 years or more. Even more ominously, no one
            knows the ultimate consequences of the worldwide dispersion of
            plastic fragments that can concentrate the toxic chemicals already
            present in the world’s oceans.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ironically, the debris is re-entering the oceans whence it came;
            the ancient plankton that once floated on Earth’s primordial sea
            gave rise to the petroleum now being transformed into plastic
            polymers. That exhumed life, our “civilized plankton,” is, in
            effect, competing with its natural counterparts, as well as with
            those life-forms that directly or indirectly feed on them.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the scale of the phenomenon is astounding. I now believe
            plastic debris to be the most common surface feature of the world’s
            oceans.Because 40 percent of the oceans are classified as
            subtropical gyres, a fourth of the planet’s surface area has become
            an accumulator of floating plastic debris. What can be done with
            this new class of products made specifically to defeat natural
            recycling? How can the dictum “In ecosystems, everything is used”
            be made to work with plastic?
