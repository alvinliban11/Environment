        <strong>Preface</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Books about water quality and water pollution control are generally
        directed at an audience of engineers, scientists, lawyers, or other
        water quality professionals. Because of the intended audience, these
        books usually contain highly technical, detailed information. A single
        textbook may cover one topic only, such as a particular method of
        treating wastewater or the interpretation of a specific water quality
        regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wrote this book because I felt that information about water quality
        and water pollution control should be more accessible to students of
        environmental science and ecology in particular, and others interested
        in learning more about this field. I believed it was possible to
        summarize many of the important topics in a single book. I also felt it
        was possible to write the book in sufficient detail to be useful and
        informative without being so detailed that one must be a water quality
        professional to understand it. This book, then, is the result of my
        effort to create a complete introductory reference on water quality and
        water pollution control for use by students, educators, and the general
        public.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wrote this book also because of my own interest in protecting the
        environment and my desire to help others learn more about clean water.
        I believe that informed citizens are more likely to make wise
        environmental decisions and encourage their political representatives
        to do likewise. I believe that working to maintain a clean environment
        is an important and worthwhile endeavor— not just for environmental
        professionals, but for all people.

            What is clean water? Clean water is a clear creek cascading down a
            steep mountainside, and a refreshing glass of ice water on a hot
            day. It is a spring-fed brook filled with wild trout, and rain
            falling on a parched field. It is a lush, green wetland teeming
            with vegetation and wildlife, and a dynamic estuary surging with
            the tide, filled with healthy shellfish and salmon. Clean water is
            all of these and more.

            The quality of the earth’s water is vital to our existence.
        </strong>
        We need ample clean water to quench our thirst, irrigate our fields,
        and sustain all life forms in the environment. We must have clean water
        in our homes, communities, businesses, industries, and in nature. We
        need clean water today and we will need it tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        We rely on clean water in almost every aspect of our lives. We rely on
        it for drinking, bathing, cooking, swimming, fishing, and boating. We
        count on it for growing and processing our food and nourishing the
        plants and animals. We count on the aesthetic qualities of clean water
        to nourish our souls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, we have no guarantee that clean water, relied on so
        heavily, will always be available. The supply of clean water on the
        earth is finite, and it is being threatened by water pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water pollution is a serious problem today, in spite of our efforts to
        control it. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that

        United States are unsafe for swimming, fishing, and drinking. Many of
        these waters are suffering the effects of indirect or diffuse
        discharges of pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from
adjacent lands. We call this type of water pollution<em>nonpoint source pollution</em> to differentiate it from        <em>direct</em> or <em>point source discharges</em> of pollutants into
        waterways from pipes and outfalls. The polluted waters in the United
        States include our major waterways and their tributaries. The
        Mississippi River, for instance, which drains about half of the
        continental United States, has serious water pollution problems. Water
        quality degradation caused by erosion and sedimentation, municipal and
        industrial discharges, and agricultural runoff threaten its fish and
        wildlife. Structures constructed on the Mississippi for navigation and
        flood control also contribute to the decline in water quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Columbia River, which drains most of the northwestern United States
        and parts of British Columbia, also has water pollution problems.
        Municipal and industrial discharges and agricultural runoff deliver a
        wide variety of pollutants to the river. Some of these pollutants, like
        dioxins and pesticides, are toxic in extremely small concentrations.
        Dams constructed on the Columbia River for hydropower and irrigation
        have altered water quality and fish habitat, contributing to the near
        extinction of some populations of salmon. The spring Chinook salmon run
        on the Columbia, which once numbered one hundred thousand fish or more,
        dwindled to an estimated ten to fifteen thousand in 1995, a decrease of
        almost ninety percent. The Snake River sockeye salmon, which migrate up
        the Columbia River, have fared even worse. In 1994, only one wild
        sockeye salmon returned to its spawning ground in Redfish Lake, Idaho.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tributaries of these major waterways, such as Oregon’s Tualatin River—a
        tributary of the Columbia—also are threatened by water pollution. The
        Tualatin River has high nutrient concentrations due to municipal and
        industrial discharges, stormwater runoff, and natural soil conditions.
        These high concentrations of nutrients, combined with warm water
        temperatures, cause unsightly algal blooms and unhealthy, fluctuating
        oxygen levels.

        Even greater problems exist in other parts of the world, where water
        quality has been a lower priority until recently. Parts of the Baltic
        Sea in Eastern Europe, for example, contain almost no fish or other
        aquatic life because of water pollution. Industries and municipalities
        in Germany, Poland, Denmark, and other surrounding countries have
        discharged untreated or partially treated wastes and wastewaters into
        the Baltic Sea for decades. Now, parts of the Baltic Sea’s water and
        sediment are severely contaminated and few organisms can survive. In
        southern Poland, the Vistula River and others like it are highly
        contaminated with pollutants from mining and other heavy industrial
        activities. In other parts of Poland, rivers are contaminated with
        pollutants from food processing plants, textile mills, and municipal
        wastes. Many municipalities and industries still discharge untreated
        wastes and wastewaters into Poland’s rivers and streams.
    </p>
    <p>
        But there is hope. Until a few years ago, twenty million gallons of
        untreated municipal and industrial wastewater were pouring into the Rio
        Grande near Nuevo Laredo, Mexico every day. These untreated discharges
        were contaminating the water, sediment, and fish downstream of Nuevo
        Laredo with toxic compounds. In 1996, the community finally constructed
        a wastewater treatment plant

        and began treating these waste streams to remove pollutants prior to
        discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clearly, we cannot take clean water for granted. It is crucial to our
        survival, prosperity, and happiness and it is being threatened in all
        parts of the world. Moreover, the water environment knows no political
        boundaries. Water and the pollutants in it move freely across borders.
        We must address the world’s water pollution problems not only as
        individual states and nations, but also as members of a greater
        worldwide environmental community.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most people are concerned about clean water, yet may feel uninformed.
        They may not know about the many sources of water pollution or the
        methods used to prevent and control it. They may not be aware of the
        rules and regulations adopted to protect our water. They could be
        intimidated by the science of water pollution control. Many of us know
        how important clean water is, but we may not know how to get involved
        to help protect it.

            Where does the water environment begin? It begins where a single
            drop of rain falls to earth. This raindrop joins with others like
            it to form tiny trickles. These trickles combine and run off the
            land to create rivulets, creeks, streams, and rivers. The small
            streams and mighty rivers of the world unite to produce the vast
            oceans and seas that surround us.

        The water environment is the entire world of water that we know and
        love: from cool, clear mountain streams to the dynamic and salty
        oceans. It is the loud cascading creeks and waterfalls and the quiet,
        slow moving rivers and peaceful lakes. It is the wetland waters filled
        with lush, green vegetation and the sterile melt waters running from
        glaciers across barren landscapes. The water environment also includes
        secret waters—springs, seeps, and groundwater—and the often-invisible
        atmospheric water poised to fall on the earth in a sudden cloudburst.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>The Hydrologic Cycle</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the world of water is enormous and all encompassing, it is
        connected in a single natural cycle. Water moves from the ocean to the
        land and back to the ocean again continuously. This cyclic movement of
        water through the environment is called the hydrologic cycle. It begins
        as water moves from the ocean’s surface into the air above through
        evaporation. During evaporation, only the fresh water vapor and other
        volatile compounds enter the atmosphere. Minerals, salts, and other
        impurities are left behind in the ocean. The buildup of these minerals
        and salts over time has made the ocean salty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water evaporates into the atmosphere and forms clouds above the ocean.
        The prevailing ocean winds blow these clouds of moist air inland and as
        they rise to move over the mountaintops, the air in them cools. Because
        cold air cannot hold as much moisture as warm air, water falls from the
        clouds as rain or snow.
    </p>
    <p>
        The moment a raindrop strikes the surface of the earth, it begins its
        journey back to the sea. Sometimes the raindrop soaks into the earth
        and moves slowly into the groundwater. Sometimes it runs off the land
        surface and moves quickly in a swift-flowing stream. Other times the
        raindrop rests in deep river pools or lakes, is taken up by plants and
        animals, or enters the atmosphere again through evaporation.
        Ultimately, the raindrop makes its way back to the ocean, which is like
        a giant reservoir. Water is stored in the ocean until it is delivered
        to the land as a result of evaporation and precipitation. Once the
        water reaches the land, it begins making its way back to the ocean
        through groundwater or surface water flow, and the cycle continues.

        All the waters of the world are connected by the hydrologic cycle. The
        rivers and streams are connected to the lakes, ponds, and wetlands. The
        surface water is connected to the groundwater. The rivers are connected
        to the bays and estuaries, which are connected to the oceans and seas.
        These connections are extremely important to water quality; they allow
        materials entering the water at any point in the hydrologic cycle to
        move from one water body to the next. For instance, precipitation
        falling on exposed mine tailings high in the mountains may pick up and
        carry contaminants from the tailings into nearby streams, downstream
        lakes, and groundwater. These contaminants may show up many miles from
        their point of origin, possibly polluting a community’s drinking water
        supply.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although water takes on many different forms as it moves continuously
        through the hydrologic cycle, the world’s supply of water is finite; we
        cannot make any more of it. What we have now is all we get. Because it
        is finite, protecting its quality is crucial.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our very survival depends on it.

        <strong>Natural Conditions That Influence Water Quality</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The different forms water takes in nature—the rivers and streams, lakes
        and ponds, wetlands, bays and estuaries, oceans and seas, and
        groundwater—all have unique water quality characteristics. These
        characteristics are influenced by the activities of humans and also by
        natural conditions in the environment. Some of the more important
        natural conditions include geology, climate, the amount and type of
        vegetation present, morphological characteristics such as the size,
        shape, depth, and width of water bodies, and the location of the water
        on the earth’s landscape.

        <em>Geology</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The geology of an area determines, in large part, the mineral makeup of
        its waters. For instance, water in areas with limestone deposits
        contains limestone minerals such as calcium and magnesium. These
        minerals dissolve and enter the water when it passes over rock
        formations and soil containing limestone. Water also will pick up small
        concentrations of metals such as copper, lead, and zinc when it passes
        over rocks and soils containing these elements. Because all minerals
        dissolve to some extent in water, you can discover much about the
        mineral content in water in any

        soil and rock.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Climate</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Climate influences water quality because temperature, precipitation,
        and wind affect the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics
        of water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Temperature is one of the most important natural conditions influencing
        water quality. It affects the amount of dissolved gases, such as
        oxygen, in the water. Warm water contains less oxygen than cold water,
        making it difficult for some organisms to survive. Also, chemical and
        biological reactions occur more rapidly in warm than in cold water,
        resulting in stress on some aquatic organisms. Chapter 2 provides more
        detail about the influences of temperature and dissolved oxygen on
        water quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        The amount of precipitation falling in an area determines the number
        and size of its water bodies. Fewer water bodies exist in dry climates,
        and those that do tend to be smaller and more susceptible to pollution.
        Small bodies of water are more likely to become polluted than large
        bodies because they have less water available for diluting the effects
        of pollutants. In other words, an equal amount of pollutant would cause
        considerably more damage if discharged into a small creek than if
        discharged into a large river, simply because of dilution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wind is responsible for mixing the surface of waters, helping to enrich
        them with important gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide. Wind also
        influences the rate of evaporation from the surface of the water.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Vegetation</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The presence or absence of vegetation also influences the natural
        quality of water. In areas where it is abundant, vegetation falls into
        the water, mixes with it, breaks apart, decomposes, and becomes part of
        the water. In some cases, excessive decaying vegetation can color the
        water. For example, one of the tributaries of the mighty Amazon River
        in South America is the color of ink because of decaying organic
        material. It is called the Rio Negro, or Black River, for obvious
        reasons. The water in wetlands is often a rich, brown, tea-like color
        because of decaying vegetation. In areas where vegetation is not
        abundant—in high mountain areas above timberline, for example—water
        contains less natural organic material. Sometimes waters located above
        timberline will be crystal clear and almost sterile, containing few
        minerals and nutrients and few fish or other aquatic organisms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vegetation such as trees and shrubs growing along stream corridors
        helps maintain desirable levels of dissolved gases in the water by
        shading it and keeping it cooler. Vegetation also acts as a filter to
        remove solid particles that are suspended in the water and helps to
        bind soil particles together to prevent erosion.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Morphology</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The shape and dimensions of water bodies have a direct influence on
        their quality. For example, a shallow lake will generally be mixed
        thoroughly by the action of waves and wind. This mixing action helps to
        distribute minerals and dissolved gases equally throughout the lake. In
        contrast, a deep lake generally will not be well mixed. The bottom of
        the lake may have less oxygen and more minerals than the surface of the
        lake. Deep, unmixed lakes can develop layers, each with different water
        quality characteristics. (Stratification is the term used to describe
        this layering effect.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Because streams on steep slopes flow swiftly, they often have better
        water quality than streams on gentler slopes. Streams on steep slopes
        experience more turbulence as water cascades over rocks and logs,
        adding oxygen to the water by mixing with the air. Streams located on
        mild slopes do not have the benefit of turbulent mixing to aerate the
        water. Swift-flowing streams, however, also have greater energy for
        causing erosion. Sediment from eroded stream banks may become suspended
        in the water, increasing turbidity and lowering the quality of the
        water.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Location</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The location of a water body on the earth’s landscape determines the
        natural conditions described above—geology, climate, vegetation, and
        morphology—and thus the natural quality of its water. As in real
        estate, location means everything. For instance, a slow-moving river
        meandering through a broad, flat valley will not have the same quality
        as a high mountain stream. The high mountain stream will likely be
        clear and cool while the valley river may be turbid and warm simply
        because of location and natural conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can see now that, even without humans, each of our water bodies
        would have different characteristics because of natural conditions in
        the environment. Unfortunately, the activities of humans tend to
        compound these natural differences, giving rise to many of the concerns
        we have about water quality.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Human Activities That Affect Water Quality</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Many human activities threaten water quality. Some of these activities
        have been occurring for many generations and some began more recently.
        This section reviews these activities in relationship to the different
        water forms in the environment.

        <em>Rivers and Streams</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Rivers and streams are the highways of the water world. People have
        used them to transport themselves and their goods from the mountaintops
        to the seas for centuries. Unfortunately, humans have used them also to
        dispose of and transport their wastes, a practice that seriously
        threatens water quality in our rivers and streams.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since ancient times, villages have been built on riverbanks. Wastes
        from these villages were thrown into the rivers to be carried away. At
        first, few people lived downstream and the rivers had the natural
        capacity to assimilate the waste and cleanse themselves. This natural
        capacity for a water body to cleanse itself is called assimilative
        capacity. As the population continued to grow, however, the
        assimilative capacities of the waters were overburdened and the rivers
        could no longer cleanse themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, most of us know it is unacceptable to discharge untreated waste
        into a river or stream. Waste dumped into a river upstream will be
        carried downstream to the users below. The phrase “we all live
        downstream” is often used to remind us to use our rivers wisely,
        respecting the rights of all downstream users. In turn, we hope the
        people living upstream from us will respect our rights.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although wastewater from most communities and industries is now
        routinely treated to remove pollutants, ultimately it is discharged
        into our rivers along with any pollutants that remain after treatment.
        Our efforts to keep rivers clean and healthy compete with this age-old
        practice of using our rivers to transport wastes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes wastes enter our rivers and streams through more spread out,
        indirect, or diffuse discharges, or nonpoint source discharges. For
        instance, fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides can be carried from
        our lawns and fields into nearby waters during and after rainstorms, as
        a result of stormwater runoff.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Lakes and Ponds</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our ancestors also established settlements on the banks of lakes and
        often discharged their wastes directly into them. Today, most of us
        realize that disposing of waste directly into a lake is a poor practice
        because it causes water pollution. Unfortunately, this practice
        continues in some areas and only recently has been discontinued in
        others. As an example, raw sewage was poured into Dal Lake high in the
        Himalayan Mountains during a recent civil war. The military turned
        resort hotels located along the shoreline into encampments and
        discharged untreated sewage directly into the lake, causing it to
        become highly polluted.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Oregon, one of the more progressive environmental states in the
        United States, two municipalities were required to stop discharging
        their treated wastewater into downstream lakes only recently.
        Pollutants remaining in the wastewater, even after treatment, were
        harming the lakes. State environmental officials worked with community
        leaders to educate them about water pollution problems caused by these
        discharges. They also helped the communities find other means of
        disposal. Chapter 2 includes additional information about the problems
        associated with discharging nutrients into bodies of water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Direct discharges into lakes and ponds also occur from stormwater
        runoff. Since stormwater picks up pollutants as it runs across the
        surface of the land, all activities occurring on the land surrounding a
        lake have the potential to contribute pollutants. For instance, many
        people remain interested in having a home or summer cabin at the edge
        of a lake. Unfortunately, residential development often results in both
        direct and indirect discharges of wastes and wastewater into our lakes.
        Direct discharges of fertilizers, pesticides, nutrients, and sediment
        may result from stormwater running off properties surrounding the lake.
        These direct discharges may also include materials from improper car
        and home maintenance such as gas, oil, antifreeze, soaps, and
    </p>
    <p>
        paints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indirect discharges may occur when homes are built around a lake where
        no community sewer system is in place. People often use septic systems
        in these areas. Unfortunately, sewage from the septic tanks and their
        drain fields may seep into the groundwater and move with the
        groundwater into the lake, causing contamination. This pattern of
        polluting lakes by improper use of septic systems has occurred across
        the United States and abroad.

        <em>Wetlands</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Wetlands are truly rich. They are rich in nutrients, animal life, and
        vegetation. They support an abundant and diverse population of plants
        and animals, providing habitat for many species of aquatic vegetation
        and serving as a spawning ground and nursery for many species of fish.
        In fact, approximately one third of the plant and animal species listed
        as threatened and endangered in the United States depend on wetlands
        for habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wetlands connect the upland world with the world of open water, while
        providing a protective buffer or transition zone between the two. They
        protect the uplands from erosion by absorbing the effect of waves on
        the shoreline of open water. They also protect open water from upland
        disturbances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wetlands are also nature’s filters. They filter out pollutants as water
        moves from upland into open water bodies. (Chapter 4 includes
        additional information about this filtration process and other natural
        methods of removing pollutants from water). Wetlands provide flood
        control and groundwater recharge zones,

        replenishes it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If wetlands are so important, why is their existence in jeopardy? Until
        recently, society believed they were undesirable and unimportant. We
        have misunderstood them and considered them to be useless, unwanted
        swamps. Part of this misunderstanding comes from folklore, literature,
        and the popular media. Often, wetlands are portrayed as vile places
were evil and mysterious events occur. For example, in        <em>Oliver Twist</em>, Dickens associates evil deeds and unsavory
        characters with an area he describes as a low, unwholesome swamp
        bordering the river. Motion pictures like the Bogart and Hepburn
        classic <em>The African Queen</em> depict wetlands as undesirable
        places infested with mosquitoes and other pests.
    </p>
    <p>
        These popular misconceptions have resulted in a threat to our wetlands
        even more serious than the threat to the quality of our rivers or
        lakes.<strong> </strong>Their very existence is in jeopardy. Wetlands
        continue to be lost throughout the world at an alarming rate. In the
        United States, for example, over ninety million acres of wetlands have
        been lost to date. Scientists estimate that only a little more than
        half of the wetlands that existed when European settlers moved to
        American are still in existence. In the past, many of our wetlands were
        lost because people drained them and turned them into agricultural
        properties. Today, the biggest threat is land development. As land
        values continue to increase and developable land and agricultural land
        becomes more scarce and expensive, the pressure to eliminate wetlands
        increases. We have only recently recognized how important wetlands are
        to the environment and enacted federal and state laws and local
        ordinances to protect them.

    <p align="left">
        <em>Bays and Estuaries</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Bays and estuaries link the fresh water in our rivers and streams to
        the salt water in the ocean. These highly productive parts of the
        environment contain hundreds of species of plants and animals. They are
        dynamic, and fluctuate according to the movement of the tides and the
        changes in the fresh and salt water entering
    </p>
    <h1>
        <a name="_Toc157863">them.</a>
    </h1>
    <p>
        On an incoming tide, saltwater enters the bay from the ocean and mixes
        with fresh water from upstream tributaries. The movement of saltwater
        and fresh water in and out of the bay in response to the tide and the
        inflows from tributaries creates brackish water—a mixture of salt and
        fresh water. Because of the constantly changing effects of the tide and
        tributaries, the characteristics of the water in a bay vary
        considerably with time and location.
    </p>
    <p>
        The water quality in our bays and estuaries is threatened by upstream
        activities, since wastes discharged into our rivers and streams are
        carried into the bays and estuaries below. These waste materials may
        stay suspended while in the river because of the rapid movement and
        energy of the water, but when the river slows down as it reaches the
        estuary, the waste materials settle out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the activities that take place in our bays and estuaries also
        threaten their quality. For instance, the practice of storing and
        distributing petroleum products out of our bays and estuaries for
        transportation efficiency can result in contamination of both open
        water and shoreline if they are spilled or leaked. Also, boat

        can harm water quality and aquatic organisms. For instance, shellfish
        growing in waters contaminated with tributilin (TBT), an additive used
        in boat paint to keep barnacles from growing on the hull, become
        deformed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the studies conducted on water pollution in bays and estuaries
        have focused on shellfish because of public health concerns and because
        of the economic importance of shellfish to coastal communities.
        Bacteria from animal and human wastes that enter the water have
        contaminated shellfish and have become a recurring problem in some
        areas. To protect the health of the organisms living in our bays and
        estuaries, as well as our own health, we must become aware of and begin
        controlling the activities that pollute them.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Oceans and Seas</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Like bays and estuaries, our oceans and seas are forever changing.
        Their characteristics change due to climatic conditions and to
        movements of the moon and earth. Unfortunately, their characteristics
        have also changed for the worse because of human
    </p>
    <p>
        activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        People have always discharged their wastes into the seas and they
        continue to do so. Because of their vast size, society has incorrectly
        assumed that oceans have an infinite capacity to assimilate waste
        materials. In recent years we have learned more about the finite nature
        of the oceans and the localized effects of pollution. For instance,
        medical wastes discharged into the Atlantic Ocean, including used
        needles and syringes, have washed up on beaches in the eastern United
        States. As previously mentioned, almost no fish or other aquatic life
        forms exist in parts of the Baltic Sea because industrial and municipal
        wastes have polluted the aquatic habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps the biggest threat to the quality of water in our oceans and
        seas comes from oil spills. The 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in the Gulf
        of Alaska (see Chapter 3) is one extreme example of this. The Gulf of
        Mexico has also been severely damaged by oil pollution. Water and
        sediment in the Gulf of Mexico and tributaries such as Mexico’s
        Coatzacoalcos River are highly contaminated with petroleum products.
        This area, which supports the largest petroleum refinery complex in
        Latin America, has been the site of a number of disastrous oil spills.
        Petroleum spills in the Persian Gulf, the North Sea, and other parts of
        the world are also degrading water quality in our oceans and seas.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indirect discharges also threaten water quality in the oceans. Because
        of the hydrologic cycle, all materials entering upstream waters that
        are not removed naturally or through treatment are discharged into the
        oceans. The oceans and seas are the ultimate sinks for all of the water
        on the planet and all of the pollutants dissolved or suspended in the
        water.
    </p>
    <p>
        The oceans and seas are not infinite. They are particularly susceptible
        to the localized effects of pollution. We threaten their quality every
        time we discharge pollutants into them directly or indirectly.

        <em>Groundwater</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Groundwater is water stored in the soil and rock formations below the
        earth’s surface. It is the primary source of drinking water for many
        communities and the secondary source for others. Groundwater is used
        extensively for irrigation. It is also an important source of water for
        rivers and streams, especially during extended dry periods. Groundwater
        emerging at the bases of mountains and foothills provides the base flow
        of streams in the area during the dry season.
    </p>
    <p>
        Groundwater provides the single largest supply of fresh water on the
        planet. It is used more extensively now than ever before because of
        society’s increasing demand for fresh water. It is also being used more
        frequently today because drought conditions and contamination of
        surface water have reduced the availability of clean, fresh water at
        the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you learned earlier in this chapter, groundwater is connected to all
        other water forms in the environment through the hydrologic cycle.
        These connections make the threat of contamination to the surface water
        a threat to groundwater quality as well.

        Activities taking place at the earth’s surface are primarily
        responsible for groundwater pollution. For example, groundwater
        pollution can occur due to accidental spills and improper disposal of
        petroleum products and industrial solvents; over-application of
        fertilizers, pesticides, food wastes, and animal wastes to the land;
        and the use of septic systems in unsuitable locations.
    </p>

        Because groundwater is usually remote and inaccessible, it is difficult
        or impossible to clean once it becomes polluted. Methods of cleaning
        groundwater, such as isolating the contaminated area and pumping and
        treating the contaminated water, are not always successful. Regardless
        of success, attempts to clean groundwater are always expensive.

        <em>Atmospheric Water</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of the hydrologic cycle, water evaporating from the ocean
        enters the atmosphere and then falls onto the land or back into the
        ocean as precipitation. This atmospheric water is the initial source of
        all fresh water in the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recall that when water evaporates off the ocean’s surface, salts,
        minerals, and other impurities that do not evaporate are left behind.
        Thus, atmospheric water enters the hydrologic cycle in a relatively
        pure form. Unfortunately, the quality of the water in our atmosphere is
        threatened by air pollution. Air contaminated with sulfur and nitrogen
        compounds, for instance, mixes with water in the atmosphere and
        produces acids. When this contaminated atmospheric water falls as
        precipitation, it turns into acid rain, damaging and degrading the
        soil, vegetation, and water below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Acid rain has been responsible for widespread environmental damage
        throughout the world, from the Appalachian and Adirondack Mountains of
        the eastern United States to the mountains of Eastern Europe and
        Scandinavia. Acid rain is particularly damaging to the aquatic
        environment. It has caused thousands of lakes and other water bodies
        throughout the world to become too acidic to support fish or other
        aquatic organisms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Air polluted with carbon compounds contributes to another water quality
        concern: the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect, which is caused
        by atmospheric pollution insulating the earth and making it retain heat
        like a greenhouse, is thought to be warming the entire planet,
        including the polar ice caps and all the earth’s waters. This condition
        is an important water quality concern because changes in the earth’s
        temperature have a profound effect on all parts of the water
        environment. The temperature of the earth not only controls the melting
        and freezing of water, it controls the rates of chemical and biological
        reactions and the concentration of gases in the earth’s water.

        This chapter introduced you to the water environment and the natural
        cycle that connects all waters on earth: the hydrologic cycle. It
        introduced you to the natural conditions that influence water quality
        and to some important concerns about different waters. You can more
        fully appreciate these natural conditions and concerns if you
        understand some of the basic chemical and biological properties of
        water. The next chapter introduces you to many of the practical
        concepts in water chemistry and microbiology.

            colorless, odorless gases. When they are brought together, they
            form water vapor, liquid water, or ice, depending on temperature
            and pressure.

        The basic concepts of water chemistry and microbiology introduced in
        this chapter will help you to better understand water quality and water
        pollution control. You do not have to be an engineer or a scientist, or
        be particularly good at math, to learn these concepts. This chapter
        presents them in simple and practical terms without using complex
        formulas and equations. However, additional references are listed at
        the end of the chapter for those interested in exploring specific
        topics in more detail.

        Most of the terms used to describe the characteristics of water come
        from the disciplines of chemistry and microbiology. You may have heard
        some of these terms and wondered exactly what they meant. Reading this
        chapter will help you learn the language of water quality and water
        pollution control. You can also see the Glossary in the back of this
        book for definitions of useful terms.

        <strong>The Water Molecule</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The smallest unit of water is called a molecule. It is made up of two
        atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen, resulting in the familiar
        chemical term for water: H<sub>2</sub>O. The chemical makeup of water
        gives it specific characteristics, such as its density and its ability
        to dissolve substances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Density is a measure of the weight of a certain volume of a substance.
        For instance, a gallon of water weighs about eight pounds. The
        temperature of water helps determine its density. Cold water is denser,
        and therefore heavier, than warm water. This relationship is
        responsible for seasonal changes in water quality in some lakes. In the
        fall, the water on the surface of a lake cools and becomes denser than
        the water below, causing the surface water to sink. The warmer, lighter
        water on the bottom of the lake responds by rising to the surface,
        causing an overturn of the lake. This overturn results in a mixing of
        the suspended solids, nutrients, and dissolved gases in the lake’s
        water (these substances are described later in this chapter).
    </p>
    <p>
        Water is less dense when it exists as a solid than when it exists as a
        liquid. Thus, a gallon of ice weighs slightly less than a gallon of
        water. Water has this unusual property because water molecules expand
        when they freeze. Have you ever placed a water jug in the freezer only
        to have the water freeze, expand, and break the container? This
        property causes ice cubes to float in a glass of water and icebergs to
        float in the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
        The way hydrogen and oxygen are held together to form an individual
        water molecule, and the way each molecule is connected to the next, is
        called chemical bonding. The type of chemical bonding exhibited by
        water allows it to dissolve substances easily, making it a good
        solvent. Almost all solids, liquids, and gases placed in water will
        dissolve to some extent. Even solid copper and lead will dissolve
        slightly when placed in water or when water runs over rock or soil
        formations containing these elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the substances that dissolve in water <em>reduce</em> its
        quality and some <em>improve</em> it. For example, when lead dissolves
        in water, it reduces its quality. When oxygen gas dissolves, it
        generally improves the water’s quality and benefits the organisms
        living in it.
    </p>
    <p>
        We often measure dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH to characterize
        the quality of our water. These measurements tell us if the water is of
        sufficient quality for its intended uses. We also measure other
        substances to help characterize our water, including organic
        substances, inorganic substances, solids, nutrients, toxics, and
        microorganisms.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Dissolved Oxygen and Temperature</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Dissolved oxygen is oxygen gas dissolved in water. Think of it in the
        same way you think of gas bubbles dissolved in a soft drink. The gas
        bubbles in a soft drink are bubbles of carbon dioxide injected into the
        solution during the carbonation process. Dissolved oxygen is oxygen gas
        that is entrained in the water as a result of water mixing with air
        containing oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Different types of water bodies contain different amounts of dissolved
        oxygen. A fast-flowing river usually contains more dissolved oxygen
        than a slow-moving one because it mixes rapidly with air containing
        oxygen while moving over rocks, logs, and debris in the stream. The
        highest concentration of oxygen is found in the whitewater stretches
        where the greatest amount of mixing occurs. Slow-moving rivers have
        less oxygen in them because they do not mix as rapidly with the air as
        they meander along.
    </p>
    <p>
        Almost all water bodies contain dissolved oxygen, regardless of their
        turbulence. Even a still lake contains oxygen because oxygen from the
        atmosphere will dissolve on its surface. The transfer of oxygen from
        the atmosphere to the surface of a lake, or any other water body, is
        increased by the mixing action of wind and waves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dissolved oxygen is an important element in water because fish and most
        other aquatic organisms use it for respiration. Although fish don’t
        breath the same way we do, their respiration process serves the same
        purpose. Fish take in water containing dissolved oxygen through their
        gills and circulate the oxygen through their bloodstream to provide
        energy. Just as humans cannot live without sufficient oxygen in the
        air, fish and other aquatic organisms cannot live without sufficient
        dissolved oxygen in the water.

        Most cold water fish such as trout and salmon prefer dissolved oxygen
        to be in the range of about eight to twelve parts of oxygen per million
        parts of water, or more. If the amount of dissolved oxygen falls much
        below this range, the fish will, if possible, move to waters containing
        more oxygen, or else they will become stressed or perish. Oxygen is
        especially important to fish during their periods of reproduction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water quality professionals express the concentration of substances
        found in water in several different ways. Parts per million (ppm) can
        be understood by thinking of a container filled with a million marbles
        of equal size and weight. A reported concentration of ten parts per
        million of dissolved oxygen is equivalent to expressing that ten of the
        one million marbles are dissolved oxygen and the rest are water.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other common way of expressing the concentration of substances in
        water is by stating the weight, or mass, of the substance found in one
        liter of water. For example, if the weight of solids in one liter of
        water is one hundred milligrams, the concentration is reported as 100
        milligrams per liter (mg/L). Because one liter of water weighs
        approximately one million milligrams, the terms mg/L and parts per
        million are essentially

        />
    </p>
    <p>
        equivalent. In other words, reporting the concentration of dissolved
        oxygen as ten parts per million is the same as reporting the
        concentration as 10 mg/L.
    </p>
    <p>
        As discussed in the last chapter, the amount of dissolved oxygen in a
        water body is affected by temperature. Oxygen is more soluble—meaning
        that it dissolves more readily—in cold than in warm water. One could
        say that cold water has a greater natural affinity for oxygen molecules
        than warm water. This relationship between temperature and dissolved
        oxygen causes a reduction in dissolved oxygen as the temperature of a
        fresh water body increases, as shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, when a fresh water body is 10°C (50°F), the solubility of
        dissolved oxygen is 11.3 mg/L. If the temperature of the water body is
        increased to 15°C (59°F), the solubility is reduced to 10.1 mg/L. Most
        cold water fish prefer water with temperatures ranging from about 0°C
        to 15°C (32°C to 59°F). This temperature range generally provides them
        with a sufficient concentration of dissolved oxygen for their life
        processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        When dissolved oxygen is at its maximum concentration, or solubility,
        at a given temperature, the water is saturated with oxygen. Most
        unpolluted, pristine waters—such as high mountain rivers and creeks—are
        ninety-five to one hundred percent saturated with dissolved oxygen.
        When waters become polluted, particularly with carbon and nitrogen
        compounds, they lose dissolved oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to affecting the concentration of dissolved oxygen, water
        temperature also influences the rates of chemical and biological
        reactions, which generally increase with a rise in temperature. For
        example, bacteria and algae grow more rapidly in warm water than in
        cold water. This increase in the rate of reactions—which typically
        requires more oxygen, particularly for bacteria—coupled with a decrease
        in the amount of dissolved oxygen available, can stress aquatic
        organisms when water becomes too warm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because warm water can be harmful to many species of aquatic organisms,
        activities that increase the temperature of the water are generally
        undesirable. Today, industries that use large quantities

        production processes. This cooled water can be discharged into a nearby
        waterway without increasing the waterway’s temperature. Foresters are
        beginning to modify their logging practices by leaving the trees that
        grow near streams to shade the water, keeping it cool. These uncut
        areas are called buffer zones because they buffer out, or minimize, the
        effects of pollutants. The term thermal pollution is used to describe
        discharges that cause undesirable shifts in water temperature.

        <strong>pH</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        pH is an abbreviation representing the activity or concentration of
        hydrogen ions in a solution. It describes the acidic or basic (also
        called alkaline) condition of liquids on a scale that ranges from 0.0
        to 14.0. Liquids having a pH of 7.0, such as distilled water, are
        neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Liquids with a pH lower than 7.0 are
        acidic. Strongly acidic substances are called acids. Liquids with a pH
        greater than 7.0 are basic. Strongly basic substances are called bases.

        Acids and bases can be dangerous to humans and the water environment.
        They cause irritations and burning and can be extremely toxic to
        aquatic organisms. Fortunately, acids and bases have the ability to
        neutralize the effect of each other. For instance, you can neutralize
        an acid with a low pH by adding a base to it to bring it to a pH of
        about 7.0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many industries commonly use acids and bases in their production
        processes. The wastewaters generated from these processes are either
        acidic or basic and must be neutralized before being discharged in
        order to prevent water pollution. For instance, a company using acid in
        its production processes, such as a circuit board manufacturer, may
        generate an acidic wastewater with a pH of about 2.0. This industry
        would typically treat its wastewater by adding a base to neutralize the
        effect of the acid, obtaining a pH of approximately 7.0 before
        discharging it back into the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most rivers, lakes, and other natural water bodies have a pH ranging
        from about 6.0 to 8.5. The type and amount of dissolved minerals,
        gases, and aquatic organisms in the water determine the pH of water in
        nature. Most aquatic organisms cannot live if the pH of the water gets
        much outside of this natural range.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Organic Substances</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Organic substances are materials made from carbon, such as plants and
        animals. All living organisms, from the largest tree to the smallest
        insect, are organic. All the foods we eat and all materials that are
        living or were once living, such as fallen timber, decaying vegetation,
        and petroleum products, are organic substances. Most organic carbon
        materials occur naturally; others are synthesized in the laboratory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many municipal, agricultural, and industrial wastes that are
        responsible for causing water pollution are organic. For instance,
        human wastes, animal wastes, and food processing wastes all consist
        primarily of organic materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water quality professionals have developed special tests to measure the
        amount of organic material in water samples. The two tests they use
        most often are those that measure biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and
        chemical oxygen demand (COD).
    </p>
    <p>
        The BOD test is a laboratory procedure used to measure the natural
        process known as biodegradation. In biodegradation, small organisms
        that exist naturally in the environment—particularly bacteria—decompose
        organic substances by using them as a food source. In essence, the
        small organisms eat the organic substances. For example, if you put a
        banana peel out in your garden and leave it for a long time, it will
eventually disappear into the soil. The living organisms, called        <em>biota</em>, in your garden soil will <em>degrade </em>the organic
        banana peel, hence the term biodegradation.
    </p>
    <p>
        To conduct the BOD test, a technician places a water sample in a small
        bottle about the size of a canning jar. The amount of dissolved oxygen
        in the water sample is measured and the bottle is placed in a warm room
        for five days. During these five days, naturally occurring bacteria—or
        “seed” bacteria added to the bottle—begin to biodegrade the organic
        material in the sample. As the bacteria decompose the organic
        substances, they use dissolved oxygen in the bottle for performing
        their life processes, such as respiration, metabolism, and
        reproduction. The technician measures the amount of dissolved oxygen in
        the water sample again at the end of the five-day period. The
        difference between the amount of oxygen at the beginning and end of the
        BOD test is

    </p>
    <p align="left">
        Laboratory BOD bottles
    </p>
    <p>
        called the oxygen demand or biochemical oxygen demand. The test
        measures the amount of oxygen used to biodegrade the organic substances
        in the bottle, which is an indirect measure of the amount of organic
        material in the original water sample.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because the test is conducted over a five-day period, it is often
referred to as a five-day<em> </em>biochemical oxygen demand (BOD        <sub>5</sub>) test. Water quality professionals commonly use a five-day
        test period, in part, because of the history of water pollution
        control. When scientists and engineers began studying water pollution,
        they estimated it would take five days for water to travel from the
        mountains to the sea. They reasoned that this time period would be
        satisfactory for conducting their oxygen demand tests. This practice of
        conducting the test over a five-day period continues today.
    </p>
    <p>
        The COD test also measures the amount of organic material in a water
        sample by measuring the oxygen demand. In the COD test, however,
        chemicals added to the sample—instead of bacteria— are responsible for
        breaking down, or oxidizing, the organic material.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally, the BOD test is used for municipal wastewaters and the COD
        test is used for industrial wastewaters. Organic substances measured as
        BOD or COD are important because they can affect the amount of
        dissolved oxygen in a stream in the same way they affect dissolved
        oxygen in the sample bottle. When organic substances enter a stream,
        they biodegrade. The bacteria in the stream use the organic materials
        for food and the dissolved oxygen in the water for energy and
        respiration. This process removes the dissolved oxygen needed by fish
        and other aquatic organisms from the stream. As mentioned earlier, the
        problem of having low levels of dissolved oxygen is compounded when the
        water is warm, because bacteria grow more rapidly and thus require more
        oxygen, but less oxygen is available.
    </p>
    <p>
        When not managed properly, organic waste materials can kill fish and
        other aquatic species. For example, if animal waste from a cattle
        feedlot is not managed properly and is allowed to enter a waterway, the
        cattle waste will begin decomposing and strip oxygen from the water.
        Without oxygen, fish and many other aquatic organisms will not survive.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Inorganic Substances</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Inorganic substances include rocks and minerals; metals such as gold,
        silver, copper, lead, zinc, and chrome; and solids like sand, silt, and
        clay. Many of the forms of nitrogen and phosphorus used for fertilizer
        are also inorganic substances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Calcium and magnesium, two of the many inorganic substances found in
        rocks and minerals, are important because they are responsible for
        creating hard water deposits on plumbing fixtures and in industrial
        boilers. Waters with high concentrations of calcium and magnesium are
        called hard waters. Other inorganic substances found in rocks and
        minerals, such as sulfur compounds, are important because they can
        cause taste and odor problems in drinking water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Humans use metals for many different purposes. We use gold, silver, and
        copper in jewelry. We use silver for photography. We use chrome for
        making car bumpers and tanning leather. We have used lead in paints and
        fuels. We commonly use metals in products ranging from automobiles to
        computers to kitchen appliances. Because we use metals so extensively,
        they can enter the water by many different pathways. Metals will
        dissolve slightly when placed in water, or when water runs over rocks
        and minerals containing metals. These dissolved metals can be toxic to
        aquatic organisms if their concentrations get too high.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even in low concentrations, long-term exposure to metals can affect the
        health of aquatic organisms and humans. For example, human infants
        exposed to lead have abnormal brain development. Until recently, we
        used leaded gasoline, which caused relatively high concentrations of
        lead to build up on our highways. During rainstorms, this lead was
        washed off the roadway by stormwater runoff and entered nearby waters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because many metals and other inorganic materials are not very soluble
        in water, they are usually found on the banks or bottoms of water
        bodies or in solids suspended in the water.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Solids</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Solids found in water consist of both inorganic and organic materials,
        such as soil particles and small pieces of vegetation, respectively.
        They are an important water quality concern because they cause
        turbidity, which can be harmful to fish because it reduces visibility.
        Also, the solids causing turbidity can be abrasive to their gills.
        Solids falling to the stream bottom can cover and harm bottom dwelling,
        or benthic, organisms. Excessive solids also make it difficult and
        expensive to treat drinking water and to disinfect
    </p>
    <p>
        wastewater.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tests for total suspended solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids (TDS)
        help determine the amount and types of solids found in a water sample.
        A technician measures TSS by passing a sample of water through a clean
        filter, much like a coffee filter. The solids left on the filter after
        the water passes through it are the suspended solids. The technician
        weighs the filter before and after passing the water to determine the
        weight of the total suspended solids in the sample. The filter is dried
        before the final weighing so that the moisture in the filter is not
        included in the weight of the solids.
    </p>
    <p>
        The technician collects the water passing through the filter in a glass
        container. Some of the solids in the water sample are so
    </p>

        small they pass completely through the filter, but are captured in the
        glass container. The technician places the glass container on a burner
        and boils off the water. The solids left on the bottom of the container
        after the water boils off are so small they are difficult to see.
        However, wiping the bottom of the container with a clean paper towel
        picks up a slight residue. This residue consists of the dissolved
        solids in the sample. The technician weighs the glass container before
        and after the test to determine the weight of the
    </p>
    <p>
        TDS.
    </p>
    <p>
        By adding together the TSS and the TDS, the technician obtains all of
        the solids in the sample, referred to as the total solids (TS).
    </p>
    <p>
        The solids found in a water sample are reported in units of
        concentration. For example, if one liter of water is passed through the
        filter, and the suspended solids retained on the filter weigh four
        hundred milligrams, then the concentration of TSS is reported as 400
        mg/L. If the dissolved solids passing through the filter weigh one
        hundred milligrams, then the concentration of TDS in the sample is
        reported as 100 mg/L. The TS concentration in the sample is the
        combination of these two values, or 500 mg/L.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you read about the concentration of materials found in water, it
        may be difficult to get a sense of the quantities involved. To aid your
        understanding, try thinking about the small packets of salt and pepper
        found at some restaurants. Each of these packets contains about 500
        milligrams of salt or pepper. If you emptied one of these packets of
        salt into one liter of distilled water, the concentration of salt in
        the water would be 500 mg/L. Now, suppose you add one 500-milligram
        packet of pepper to the same container filled with one liter of
        distilled water. You would then have 500 mg of salt and 500 mg of
        pepper in one liter of water. The salt would eventually dissolve and
        become dissolved solids. The pepper would not dissolve, so it would
        become suspended solids. A solids analysis of your one liter of
        seasoned water would result in a measurement of 500 mg/L of TDS (the
        salt), 500 mg/L of TSS (the pepper) and 1000 mg/L of TS (the salt plus
        the pepper).
    </p>
    <p>
        Chapter 5 presents ways that total suspended solids and total dissolved
        solids are regulated by permits and water quality standards to protect
        water quality.

    <p align="left">
        <em>Nutrients</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nutrients are the elements all living organisms need for growth. They
        are the nutritional building blocks of bacteria, fish, trees, and
        humans. They are what we are made of. When farmers apply fertilizer to
        their fields, they are adding nutrients to help their crops grow.
        Nutrients come in both organic and inorganic forms. The most important
        nutrients in water quality and water pollution control are carbon,
        nitrogen, and phosphorus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Carbon is one of the most abundant elements on earth. It can be found
        in plants, animals, soil, and the air we breathe. It is one of the key
        building blocks of all living things. Because it is so important, it is
        used by nature over and over again. It is recycled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bacteria are the best recyclers in nature. They remove carbon from
        organic materials through the biodegradation process, then use some of
        the recycled carbon to form new cells and release the rest into the
        atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide gas. Green plants use the
        carbon in carbon dioxide gas as building blocks for their growth. This
        carbon recycling process occurs naturally in the environment and is
        essential for life on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, when too much carbon is released into our waterways in an
        uncontrolled manner, such as discharging untreated municipal sewage or
        industrial waste, it causes water pollution. Carbon in the discharged
        sewage or industrial waste is biodegraded and recycled in the water by
        naturally occurring bacteria. During biodegradation, bacteria remove
        dissolved oxygen from the water for energy and respiration. Because
        bacteria use up oxygen during biodegradation, they leave little for
        fish or other aquatic organisms. Recall that dissolved oxygen from the
        water is needed for respiration by aquatic organisms in the same way we
        need oxygen from the air. In summary, the uncontrolled discharge of
        carbon into the environment results in the removal of oxygen from the
        water, threatening the health of fish and other aquatic species.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the ways we prevent substances containing carbon from polluting
        our waters is by constructing municipal and industrial wastewater
        treatment plants. These treatment plants remove most of the materials
        containing carbon from the wastewater before it is discharged. Chapter
        4 presents more detailed information about municipal and industrial
        treatment processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nitrogen is also an abundant element in the environment and it is an
        essential nutrient for plant and animal growth. Bacteria recycle
        nitrogen through biodegradation in much the same way they recycle
        carbon. They use part of the nitrogen for cell growth and turn the rest
        into less complex forms of nitrogen, such as ammonia, nitrogen gas, and
        other inorganic forms of nitrogen.
    </p>
    <p>
        One form of inorganic nitrogen that is responsible for problems in
        drinking water is called nitrate. Infants who drink water with too much
        nitrate in it—more than 10 mg/L—may be stricken with an ailment called
        methemoglobinemia, or “blue baby” disease. When nitrate gets into an
        infant’s blood stream, it reduces the amount of oxygen carried by the
        red blood cells. Because it does not get enough oxygen, the infant
        turns blue and can die. Adults do not have the same problems with
        nitrate in their drinking water because their respiratory systems are
        more fully developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like carbon, the uncontrolled discharge of nitrogen in the form of
        ammonia or organic nitrogen also can cause water pollution due to loss
        of oxygen from the water during the biodegradation
    </p>
    <p>
        process.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other major nutrient of concern in water quality protection is
        phosphorus. Unlike carbon and nitrogen, phosphorus is not always an
        abundant element in the environment, yet it is necessary for the growth
        of all living things. When phosphorus is not available, organisms will
        not grow. For example, one of the reasons high mountain waters are so
        clear is that they lack enough phosphorus to support the growth of many
        aquatic organisms. When the absence of phosphorus or any other element
        limits biological growth, it is called the limiting nutrient.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having too many organisms growing in our waters is generally
        undesirable. An abundance of aquatic organisms such as algae growing in
        a water body may cause it to turn green and turbid. In addition to
        being unsightly, algae can cause undesirable shifts in pH and dissolved
        oxygen in the water.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img

    </p>
    <p align="right">
        Lily pad pond, Columbia River Gorge, Washington
    </p>
    <p>
        In waters where phosphorus is the limiting nutrient, the abundant and
        undesirable growth of algae and other aquatic organisms can be
        prevented and controlled by minimizing the amount of phosphorus
        available. To achieve this goal, some communities have banned or
        restricted the use of detergents made of phosphorus to reduce the
        amount of phosphorus discharged into their waters. Others have added
        special treatment processes to their sewage treatment plants to remove
        phosphorus. Farmers have been encouraged to limit their use of
        fertilizers to prevent excess amounts from being washed off of their
        property and into area streams.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a water body is rich in nutrients, causing certain organisms such
        as algae to grow abundantly, it is eutrophic. When a water body
        contains few nutrients or has very low concentrations of nutrients and
        little biological growth, it is oligotrophic. When a water body is
        between these two extreme trophic conditions, it is called mesotrophic.
    </p>
    <p>
        These trophic conditions can be natural states of water bodies related
        to their location on the earth’s landscape (see Chapter 1). Water
        bodies that are away from natural nutrient sources tend to be
        oligotrophic and water bodies that are near abundant natural nutrient
        sources, or are subject to pollution, may be eutrophic. When the
        activities of humans add pollutants and nutrients to the water, we are
        contributing to eutrophication.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Toxics</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The chemical substances most detrimental to water quality are the toxic
        compounds. In contrast to nutrients that increase biological activity,
        toxic substances can cause death and deformation of the organisms in
        the water.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most commonly used toxic compounds is chlorine. Chlorine is
        used throughout the world as a disinfectant to kill harmful organisms
        and to protect human health. Unfortunately, the same characteristics
        that make it a good disinfectant—its ability to kill quickly in low
        concentrations—also make it harmful to the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chlorine is used to kill harmful organisms like bacteria and viruses at
        sewage treatment plants. However, it may also kill or harm desirable
        organisms such as fish and reptiles when the treated wastewater, called
        effluent, is discharged back into the environment. Chlorine toxicity
        can be avoided if the concentration of chlorine is kept low and if the
        effluent is discharged into a large, well-mixed water body.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes it is necessary to chemically remove chlorine from the
        effluent before discharging, to prevent toxicity. This dechlorination
        process is often accomplished by injecting sulfur dioxide gas into the
        effluent. The sulfur dioxide gas reacts with the chlorine molecules,
        converting them into nontoxic chloride molecules. Using other nontoxic
        methods to disinfect the wastewater, such as passing the effluent
        through ultraviolet light or adding ozone, can also prevent chlorine
        toxicity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chlorine is also used in the process of bleaching pulp to make paper
        white. During the bleaching process, chlorine molecules combine with
        organic molecules in the pulp to form harmful compounds called
        chlorinated organics. The most harmful of these chlorinated organic
        compounds are the dioxins. Members of the dioxin family of compounds
        have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals in extremely
        small concentrations. For instance, one type of dioxin called 2,3,7,8
        TCDD has an established drinking water standard of 0.00000003 mg/L due
        to its harmful effects in low concentrations. (Chapter 7 provides more
        information about drinking water standards). Because of the toxicity of
        chlorinated organic compounds like dioxins, pulp and paper mills are
        working to reduce or eliminate the use of chlorine in their bleaching
        processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ammonia is another common toxic compound. It is formed from the
        breakdown of organic materials containing nitrogen. It is found
        throughout the environment and in municipal and industrial wastewaters.
        Ammonia is not a concern in low concentrations (less than 1.0 mg/L),
        but it becomes toxic in high concentrations, especially in waters that
        are warm or have a high pH. Waters with these conditions cause ammonia
        to be in its most toxic chemical form: un-ionized ammonia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many other organic substances are also toxic. For example, petroleum
        products such as gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and kerosene are all toxic
        organic compounds. Other toxic organic chemicals include widely used
        pesticides and herbicides such as alachlor, aldicarb, atrazine,
        chlordane, and 2,4-D, and organic solvents and industrial cleaners such
        as benzene and TCE. Chapter 5 describes how several of these toxic
        organic compounds are regulated to control the use and disposal of
        hazardous materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Toxic compounds can cause both short- and long-term health effects. If
        the health effects occur over a short period of time, the toxic
        compounds cause <em>acute</em> toxicity. If the health effects occur
        over a long period of time, the compounds cause <em>chronic</em>
        toxicity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Laboratory tests called bioassays can be used to evaluate the toxicity
        of municipal and industrial effluents. In bioassays, technicians place
        small organisms such as minnows, algae, or water fleas in different
        concentrations of effluent. They then monitor the health of the
        organisms to determine what dose or concentration, if any, causes
        toxicity. Toxicity can be measured as weight loss, reduced
        reproduction, or mortality.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Microorganisms</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The smallest living organisms on the earth are called microscopic
        organisms or microorganisms. These include bacteria, algae, and
        viruses. Although many microrganisms are too small to be seen with the
        naked eye, they are abundant in most natural waters. One gallon of
        river water may contain more than one million bacteria and more than
        ten thousand algae.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bacteria are simple, single-celled organisms. They are so small you
        cannot see them with the human eye alone. With the advent of the
        microscope, however, scientists found that although they are tiny, they
        are vital to life on earth.

        recycling them back into the environment. For example, they will break
        down a complex sugar molecule into carbon, oxygen, and water. Bacteria
        use some of the components for energy and growth; they release the rest
        for use by other microorganisms. The recycling activities of bacteria
        are fundamental to water quality and water pollution control.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the bacteria that affect water quality use carbon from organic
        molecules as their food source and as the building blocks for new
        cells. Many of them also use oxygen for respiration in much the same
        way humans do. Although bacteria are essential to recycling nutrients
        in the environment, and many of them are beneficial, some types of
        bacteria are responsible for human diseases. For example, certain
        species of bacteria are responsible for cholera, typhoid, dysentery,
        and other diseases that are transmitted in water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Algae are ten to one hundred times larger than bacteria. They are made
        of single cells or multiple cells. The single-celled algae are
        generally too small to be seen without a microscope, but you can see
        the multiple-celled algae with the human eye. The simple blue-green
        algae are examples of single-celled algae. A seaweed is an example of
        multiple-celled algae.
    </p>
    <p>
        Algae differ from bacteria in their energy requirements and growth
        mechanisms. Most algae are photosynthetic organisms, meaning they use
        light energy, such as energy from the sun, for growth. Because algae
        require light for growth, they are generally found only near the
        surface of most waters. Algae use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
        and the water as carbon building blocks for creating new cells.
    </p>
    <p>
        Algae grow rapidly in polluted waters that contain an abundance of
        nutrients. These waters may have an unsightly green sheen to them,
        which is characteristic of the presence of algae. Algae can also cause
        undesirable shifts in water chemistry, such as fluctuations in
        dissolved oxygen and pH in the water at different times of the day,
        depending on the amount of available light. These undesirable
        fluctuations may stress or kill other organisms living in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Viruses are the smallest microorganisms. They are ten to one hundred
        times smaller than bacteria. They are called parasites because they
        cannot live outside the cell of another organism. The organisms they
        live in are called the host organisms. Bacteria are often the host
        organisms for viruses. Viruses are responsible for causing human
        diseases such as smallpox, infectious hepatitis, influenza, yellow
        fever, and poliomyelitis. Viruses have also been linked to some types
        of cancer. Of these diseases, scientists currently believe that only
        infectious hepatitis is caused by the transmission of viruses through
        the water.

            What causes water pollution? This question has many answers. Humans
            and the various activities we participate in cause water pollution,
            as do forest fires, floods and other natural events. A catastrophe
            such as the wreck of an oil tanker can pollute our waters, but so
            can a less dramatic event like a failing septic system.

    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the most common causes of water pollution include stormwater
        runoff, domestic discharges, industrial discharges, accidental spills,
        and use of water control structures such as dams.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Stormwater Runoff</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        When rain falls on roads, parking lots, or farm fields, it either soaks
        into these surfaces or runs off. The rainwater that runs off is called
        stormwater runoff.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stormwater runoff typically contains many pollutants. For example,
        runoff from roadways and parking lots often contains oil, gasoline, and
        other automobile fluids. Runoff from farm fields may include
        pesticides, fertilizers, and animal wastes. Runoff from forested areas
        may have soil, vegetation, and other debris in it. Stormwater runoff
        from golf courses may contain pesticides and fertilizers. Industrial
        sites may produce runoff containing industrial chemicals. Runoff from
        construction or other areas where the land is being disturbed often
        contains eroded soils, dissolved minerals, and debris.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stormwater runoff carrying these pollutants enters storm gutters,
        pipes, and ditches—and ultimately our rivers, streams, and lakes. We
        only recently began treating stormwater runoff to remove pollutants
        before it enters our waterways. (Chapter 4 describes methods of
        treating stormwater.)
    </p>
    <p>
        These sources of stormwater pollution, alone and combined, have
        resulted in serious water pollution problems. Stormwater discharges
        from agricultural fields, for instance, have contaminated rivers with
        organic material and bacteria from animal waste. Stormwater discharges
        containing phosphorus have contributed to the undesirable growth of
        large numbers of algae in lakes and rivers. Stormwater discharges
        containing eroded soils have damaged fish spawning beds and other
        aquatic habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the sources causing stormwater-related pollution are referred
        to as nonpoint sources because they come from broad areas rather than
        single points of origin. How big is the problem of nonpoint source
        pollution? According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
        nonpoint sources of pollution are the

        leading cause of water pollution in the United States today. Only about
        half of the miles of rivers and acres of lakes assessed by state
        agencies have sufficient water quality to fully support their
        designated uses for fishing, swimming, and drinking. Nonpoint pollution
        from agriculture, in particular, has been cited by the EPA as a major
        cause of the degradation of these waters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other sources of pollution are referred to as point sources because
        they originate from single points of discharge, such as the ends of
        pipes. Domestic discharges are point sources of water pollution.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Domestic Discharges</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of us take modern sewage collection and treatment for granted. We
        flush the toilet and the waste goes away. Where does it go? In most
        cases, it goes either to a septic system or to a sewage treatment
        plant.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Septic Systems</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Septic systems consist of a large buried tank, usually about 1,000
        gallons (3,800 liters) in size, and a series of perforated pipes—
        called a drain field—that are placed in the soil down slope from the
        tank. Sewage solids are retained in the tank and the liquid effluent
        enters the drain field and percolates into the underlying soil. Chapter
        4 outlines the proper use of septic systems in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Millions of people in the world rely on septic systems for managing
        their sewage, making these systems a considerable source of water
        pollution when used inappropriately. Septic systems can cause water
        pollution when they are placed in areas with poor soil conditions, high
        water tables, or in areas without sufficient area for them to function
        properly. For example, septic systems do not work well when placed in
        tightly packed, fine-grained soils such as clay, because effluent from
        the septic tank cannot pass through the soil easily. Instead, it
        collects at or near the surface of the ground and may run off into
        nearby waters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Effluent from a septic tank is essentially raw sewage and it poses both
        an environmental and a health hazard. If drain pipes from the septic
        tank are too close to the water table, effluent will enter the
        groundwater before being properly treated in the soil, resulting in
        groundwater contamination. If septic systems are placed too close
        together in densely populated areas, adequate space will not be
        available for the systems to function properly. The soil will become
        overloaded beyond its capacity to adequately treat the wastewater,
        resulting in surface or ground water pollution.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Sewage Treatment Plants</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, in the United States, municipal sewage collection and
        treatment plants serve most areas where housing is dense. In areas
        where cities provide sewer service to their residents, wastewater from
        individual homes flows through house plumbing and underground sewer
        pipes to the community’s sewage treatment plant. The plant treats the
        wastewater to remove approximately eighty-five percent of the solid and
        organic materials in the wastewater, disinfects it to kill bacteria and
        viruses, and then usually discharges it into the nearest waterway.
        Chapter 4 describes the operation of sewage treatment plants in more
        detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although sewage treatment plants are intended to help prevent water
        pollution, they can also contribute to it in a number of ways. The
        solid and organic materials not removed through the conventional
        treatment process, which is approximately fifteen percent of the amount
        entering the system, can degrade water quality. For instance, when
        large volumes of effluent are discharged into small, poorly mixed
        waterways, wastewater can dominate the receiving stream, reducing the
        concentration of dissolved oxygen in the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nutrients not removed through the conventional treatment process,
        especially phosphorus, can contribute to eutrophication, causing the
        undesirable growth of algae and other nuisance organisms. Nitrogen, in
        the form of ammonia, can be toxic to fish and other aquatic species and
        can also lower dissolved oxygen in the receiving stream.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chlorine, which is commonly used for disinfection at a treatment plant,
        can be toxic to organisms in the receiving water. Again, the toxic
        effect of chlorine is more pronounced in small waterways with low flow
        rates and poor mixing conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventional municipal treatment systems do not typically treat toxic
        substances very well. Substances such as some household cleaners,
        petroleum products, metals, and other toxic compounds that are
        sometimes found in sewage can pass through the system without being
        properly treated, causing toxicity in the receiving stream. They can
        also contaminate the sewage solids removed during treatment, making
        these solids difficult to dispose of or use for beneficial purposes
        such as fertilizer without harming the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Poor performance of the treatment system due to upsets in the
        biological treatment process (see Chapter 4), operator error, or
        storm-related problems can result in the discharge of improperly
        treated sewage. Poor performance under stormy conditions is a serious
        problem for both municipal treatment plants and collection systems.
        During a rainstorm, stormwater can enter sanitary sewer pipes through
        cracks or improper joints. This stormwater flows to the treatment
        plant, where it can overload the system. These extra flows reduce the
        time available for settling and biological treatment, and can result in
        insufficient treatment of the sewage prior to discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some older communities, the pipes carrying sewage are connected to
        the pipes carrying stormwater. During rainstorms, the sewer pipes
        become so full they overflow into the stormwater pipes. These
        stormwater pipes do not go to the sewage treatment plant; they go
        directly to nearby waterways. These overflow events are called combined
        sewer overflows (CSOs). Combined sewer overflows result in untreated
        sewage being discharged directly into a nearby river or stream, posing
        both an environmental and a human health hazard.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSOs are a serious problem in larger, older cities where these combined
        sewage and stormwater collection systems were used extensively in the
        past to save money. Cities in the United States currently contending
        with CSO problems include Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; New
        York, New York; Boston,

        and others are currently spending millions of dollars to separate their
        sewage and stormwater collection systems. They are also trying to
        discover other ways of solving their CSO problems, such as treating the
        combined wastewater prior to discharge.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Industrial Discharges</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Although domestic discharges can be a significant source of water
        pollution, they usually pose less of an overall threat to water quality
        than do industrial discharges. Industrial discharges are often larger,
        and they may contain more harmful materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Large, “wet” industries like pulp and paper mills are almost always
        built near the banks of rivers because of their high demand for water.
        They obtain clean water by directing river water from upstream
        diversions to their plants below. Once the clean water reaches the
        plant, it is used in the production process and then sent to a
        treatment system to remove the pollutants acquired during production.
        This treated process water is then discharged back into the river
        downstream of the plant. Obviously, the process
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img
            width="408"

    </p>
    <p align="right">
        East River near Brooklyn Bridge, New York
    </p>
    <p>
        waters used by industry must be treated properly to prevent water
        pollution. For instance, at a pulp and paper mill, clean water is mixed
        with wood chips and chemicals during the pulping process. This
        processing water must then be treated to remove the pollutants acquired
        from both the wood and pulping chemicals prior to discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Industrial treatment systems generally remove more than ninety percent
        of the solid and organic materials in the wastewater. They also address
        other industry-specific problems by removing metals or neutralizing
        acids. However, like municipal systems, industrial treatment systems
        can also contribute to water pollution, though they are intended to
        prevent it. Water pollution problems can arise from: 1) improper
        operation and poor performance of the treatment system, 2) the adverse
        conditions caused by the ten percent or more of solids, organics, and
        other materials that cannot be not removed through standard treatment
        processes, and 3) specific chemicals that are toxic in low
        concentrations and difficult to remove entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Which industries use water in their production processes? Almost all
        industries manufacturing any type of product use water during
        production. Some of the more common industries requiring process waters
        include food processors, electronic equipment manufacturers, rare metal
        manufacturers, forest products producers, textile manufacturers,
        pharmaceutical manufacturers, pulp and paper mills, leather tanners,
        and chemical manufacturers. These industries and the many others that
        use water in their production processes must continuously provide
        proper treatment of their process waters prior to discharge to prevent
        water pollution.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Accidental Spills</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Industrial and domestic discharges and stormwater runoff are somewhat
        predictable sources of water pollution. When it rains, we know
        stormwater pollutants run off the land and enter our waterways. When
        domestic and industrial discharges are not managed properly, we know
        they can degrade the quality of our waters. Another source of water
        pollution results from events that are unpredictable: accidental
        spills.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the early hours of March 24, 1989, the thousand-foot long oil
        supertanker Exxon Valdez traveled outside of its shipping channel and
        ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. This
        catastrophe resulted in the largest and most devastating oil spill in
        United States history. Almost eleven million gallons of crude oil
        spilled into the sound. The spill migrated over an area of more than
        11,000 square miles, killing an estimated 300,000 birds and hundreds of
        mammals. The spill killed bald eagles, peregrine falcons, murres,
        loons, grebes, and puffins. It also killed and injured sea otters,
        harbor seals, salmon, and many
    </p>
    <p>
        other species.
    </p>
    <p>
        The effects of this tragic spill could have been prevented or lessened
        in many different ways. Those responsible for piloting the ship could
        have been more conscientious and more skillful in keeping the ship on
        course. The tanker could have been doublehulled to provide a secondary
        means of containment once the first hull ruptured. The emergency
        response could have been more rapid and better organized. Official
        crews did not arrive on the scene for approximately ten hours and it
        took them more than thirty-seven hours to place the floating booms used
        to corral the floating oil. (Chapter 4 describes spill prevention and
        cleanup techniques used to prevent and control water pollution.)
    </p>

        Although this major oil spill was devastating to the environment,
        nature is now recovering in Prince William Sound. Much of the oil
        floating on the surface of the sound migrated into small coves and
        inlets, protected from wind and waves, where it eventually congealed
        and fell to the bottom of the sound. Oil that had washed up on the
        shoreline adhered to soil and vegetation, where it formed sticky tar
        and asphalt-like deposits. Given enough time, these deposits of spilled
        oil will eventually be biodegraded by bacteria and other naturally
        occurring microorganisms. Although we know that biodegradation will
        eventually occur, no one knows how long it will take. Neither the
        long-term effects of the spill nor the environment’s ability to recover
        will be known for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many different types of materials have spilled into waterways in the
        United States and continue to do so, causing water quality degradation
        and killing fish and other aquatic organisms. For instance, in Oregon,
        a tractor-trailer filled with hydrochloric acid jackknifed and ran off
        the road, spilling its contents into the John Day River. In California,
        derailed train cars carrying herbicides plunged into the nearby
        Sacramento River, spilling their contents. In Idaho, a tractor-trailer
        full of industrial chemicals ran off the highway into a tributary of
        the Salmon River. In Utah, chlorine from a water treatment facility
        spilled into the Ogden River.
    </p>
    <p>
        Large spills of oil and other chemicals do not occur frequently, but
        the results are often catastrophic when they do. Some of the more
        common types of spills, however, are spilled petroleum products from
        55-gallon drums, overflows from sewage pump stations, breaks in sewer
        lines, breaks in oil and gas lines, and spills of gasoline and
        antifreeze. These lesser spills also pose a threat to water quality.

        <strong>Water Control Structures</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Dams, levees, and other water control structures alter the natural
        courses of our rivers and streams. Some control structures turn
        free-flowing waterways into standing bodies of water. These changes in
        the natural movement of our waterways can reduce
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        water quality in a number of ways. For instance, the temperature of
        water held behind a dam increases because more water surface is exposed
        to the sun and less vegetation exists to provide shade. This increase
        in temperature reduces the amount of oxygen that will dissolve in the
        water (see Chapter 2) and become available for fish and other aquatic
        organisms. The water held behind an impoundment usually has less
        natural turbulence than a moving waterway, also resulting in lower
        concentrations of dissolved oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
        By slowing down the movement of the water, control structures also
        cause pollutants suspended in the water, such as nutrients and
        sediments, to settle out of the water and concentrate. This
        slow-moving, warm water with a high concentration of nutrients provides
        a good environment for algae. As algae grow and multiply, the water can
        become green and turbid. Algae can also cause unhealthy shifts in
        dissolved oxygen and pH, as described earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Control structures can severely alter fish habitat. Waters passing
        through a dam can become over-saturated with dissolved gases, such as
        nitrogen, that are harmful to fish and other aquatics. Silt and other
        materials settling from the water held behind a dam can cover fish
        spawning beds. Migratory routes can be completely cut off or made more
        difficult. In the United States, many runs of both Atlantic and Pacific
        Salmon have been devastated because water control structures have
        disrupted their migratory routes and
    </p>
    <p>
        habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
        The loss of natural flood plains and wetlands because of the use of
        dikes and levees also reduces water quality. Flood plains filter out
        and remove pollutants as water passes through vegetation and over soil
        during flooding. These benefits are lost when dikes are placed to
        prevent water from entering them.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, although water control structures provide benefits to
        society, such as hydropower, irrigation, and flood control, they also
        contribute to water pollution. These control structures should be
        recognized not only for their benefits to society, but also for their
        costs to the environment.

    <p>
        The purpose of this chapter was to introduce you to some of the sources
        of water pollution: stormwater runoff, domestic discharges, industrial
        discharges, accidental spills, and water control structures. You
        learned that stormwater runoff is currently the leading cause of water
        pollution in the United States. In the next chapter, you will discover

    <p>
        Environmental professionals have developed many different ways of
        preventing and controlling water pollution. Some of these methods are
        as simple as managing and storing materials properly to prevent spills
        from occurring. Others involve more complex treatment processes.

        <strong>Prevention</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The old adage “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” applies
        to water pollution control. It is easier and cheaper to keep pollutants
        from entering our waters than it is to remove them. Some of the best
        opportunities available for preventing water pollution involve
        reducing, reusing, and recycling.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Reducing</em>
        means using less of an item or creating less waste. When we follow
        water conservation measures at home and in industry, we allow clean
        water to stay free of contaminants by leaving it at its source. We can
        also help prevent water pollution by reducing the generation of waste
        materials and wastewater. For example, manufacturers of laminated
        wooden beams minimize waste by reducing the amount of glue wasted in
        making the beams. Instead of rinsing off excess glue from the beams
        with water and creating glue-contaminated wastewater, employees
        carefully scrape off excess glue and save it for future use. This type
        of waste reduction provides both environmental and economic benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, almost any technique used to reduce waste helps prevent water
        pollution. When we reduce our generation of garbage and other refuse,
        less solid waste ends up in landfills. Less solid waste in landfills
        provides less opportunity for creating landfill wastewater, called
        leachate. Leachate is created when groundwater or surface water mixes
        with refuse in a landfill. In addition, we can improve water quality by
        reducing our use of harmful chemicals. Using less chlorine bleach in
        paper making, for example, minimizes the generation of harmful
        chlorinated organic compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Reusing</em>
        —using the same item more than once—also helps prevent water pollution.
        In the example used above, laminated beam manufacturers reuse the
        excess glue after scraping it off the beams. This procedure results in
        less wastewater and therefore protects water quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reusing water provides at least three important benefits: it reduces
        the demand for clean water, reduces the quantity of wastewater
        requiring treatment, and reduces the amount of treated wastewater
        discharged back into the environment. Some industries have been
        particularly effective in reusing water. They reuse process waters for
        wash down and cleanup rather than using clean water. Some
        municipalities reuse treated and disinfected wastewater for irrigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Recycling</em>
        —using the same item more than once in the same or alternate forms—is
        the third conservation practice that helps prevent water pollution. For
        example, paper recycling helps prevent water pollution by lowering the
        demand for raw timber, allowing more trees to remain on the
        mountainside for stabilizing the soil, cooling tributary waters, and
        otherwise benefiting water quality. Recycled paper is also easier to
        pulp than timber. It takes less energy, less water, and fewer chemicals
        to create recycled paper than it does to create paper from raw wood.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also can recycle other items to help prevent water pollution,
        including glass, aluminum, oil, metals, and plastics. Using these items
        in their recycled forms requires fewer virgin resources, disturbs the
        land less, and generally consumes less energy. Instead of developing a
        new mine to extract metal deposits, for instance, we can increase our
        use of recycled metals to meet all or part of the need.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chapter 8 describes in more detail several methods of reducing,
        reusing, and recycling in the home to prevent water pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other simple ways of preventing water pollution include storing
        materials that could become pollutants away from areas where they may
        enter the water. Many industries have developed material storage plans
        that outline where particular materials are to be stored. Materials
        that could become waterborne pollutants are not stored near stormwater
        inlets, gutters, ditches, or other areas where they could easily enter
        the water accidentally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Industries also prevent water pollution by properly transferring and
        handling materials such as petroleum products in order to prevent
        spills. Later sections of this chapter outline spill prevention and
        cleanup procedures.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Natural Water Pollution Control Processes</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Water quality professionals often categorize water pollution control
processes as <em>physical</em>, <em>chemical</em>, or        <em>biological</em>. Physical processes rely on the physical separation
        of pollutants from the water, chemical processes rely on chemical
        reactions, and biological processes rely on living organisms to break
        down waste materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        All techniques used to control water pollution are based on one or more
        fundamental processes that occur in nature. These natural processes
        include sedimentation, biodegradation, filtration, and
    </p>
    <p>
        sorption.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sedimentation describes the process of particles settling in water. It
        occurs naturally as a result of gravity. As the force of gravity, which
        pulls everything towards the center of the earth, acts on the
        particles, they fall to the bottom of the water body. Sedimentation is
        enhanced if the water body is still, such as in a lake, pond, or basin
        where the forces of turbulence and mixing found in fast moving waters
        are absent. Turbulent forces tend to counteract the force of gravity
        and keep materials suspended in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Mississippi River provides a good example of sedimentation in
        nature. Many years ago, prior to construction of locks and dams, the
        Mississippi flowed freely. Sand and other soil particles that eroded
        from the banks of the river became suspended in the river as it moved
        south from what is now Minnesota to Louisiana. As the river entered the
        Gulf of Mexico near what is now New Orleans, the turbulent forces of
        the river dissipated. Without the turbulent forces to keep the
        materials suspended, the sand fell to the bottom of the gulf due to
        gravity. This sedimentation process, occurring over thousands of years,
        created the Mississippi Delta—the broad, flat, fan-shaped area at the
        confluence of the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water quality professionals use the natural process of sedimentation in
        controlled settings—at industrial and municipal treatment plants, for
        instance—to remove suspended pollutants from the water. Sedimentation
        is a <em>physical</em> treatment process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Natural biodegradation<em> </em>is also a common water pollution
        control process. As you already know from Chapter 2, biodegradation
        occurs as microscopic organisms, especially bacteria, break down
        organic substances into simple carbon and nitrogen compounds and water.
        The process is called biodegradation because biota are responsible for
        decomposing, or degrading, the organic substances. Bacteria use the
        organic materials as food for energy and growth. Compounds generated in
        the biodegradation process not used by bacteria, such as carbon
        dioxide, are recycled back into the
    </p>
    <p>
        environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Biodegradation is one of the fundamental processes in nature
        responsible for recycling nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, and
        phosphorus. Communities and industries rely on biodegradation in
        controlled settings—at municipal and industrial treatment plants—to
        break down and remove waste materials from their wastewaters. When
        biodegradation is used in a controlled setting to treat wastewater it
        is called <em>biological</em> treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you make a pot of coffee, you usually use a coffee filter to keep
        the solid coffee particles out of the liquid. This process, called
        filtration, also occurs naturally in the environment. As water passes
        over the surface of the land, it moves through grass and other
        vegetation or seeps into the soil. The vegetation and the soil act as
        natural filters. Materials that are larger than the openings between
        adjacent pieces of vegetation or grains of soil are filtered out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Natural filters come in different sizes. For example, a bed of willows
        is a natural filter capable of removing large debris such as leaves,
        branches, and twigs from the water. A bed of sand is a natural filter
        that can remove smaller particles such as small pieces of vegetation
        and large soil particles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Communities and industries use filtration in controlled settings for
        water pollution control. Municipal and industrial treatment plants
        employ racks, screens, filters, and beds of sand to filter out
        different sizes of particles from wastewater. Filtration is another
        example of a <em>physical</em> treatment process.

        If you spilled water on the kitchen floor, you would probably use a
        towel, cloth, or sponge to clean it up. These items work well because
        they absorb the water. Absorption, then, is the process where one
        substance is taken into another. Some of the materials found in nature,
        like certain types of soil and vegetation, are good at absorbing
        pollutants. For instance, soils containing organic materials such as
        peat moss and decaying vegetation remove some types of organic
        pollutants by absorbing them.
    </p>
    <p>
Another natural process, similar to <em>ab</em>sorption, is called        <em>ad</em>sorption. Adsorption is the process where one material
        simply adheres to the surface of another material. Absorption and
        adsorption occur together in nature and it is difficult and usually
        unnecessary to distinguish the two. When these two processes are
        combined, the resulting process is simply called sorption.
    </p>
    <p>
        Communities and industries use the sorption process in their wastewater
treatment plants to remove pollutants. Sorption is a combined        <em>physical</em> and <em>chemical</em> treatment process.

        <strong>Stormwater Treatment</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        As explained in Chapter 3, nonpoint sources of pollution associated
        with stormwater runoff are the leading cause of water pollution in the
        United States today. A variety of methods are available for controlling
        and preventing stormwater pollution. Some of these stormwater treatment
        methods are new and some have been around for decades, if not
        centuries. Some use new applications of the fundamental treatment
        processes described above— sedimentation, biodegradation, filtration,
        and sorption—and some rely on new and old erosion control techniques.

    </p>
    <p>
        For example, some cities use grass-lined swales—also called
        bioswales—as part of new highway drainage systems to remove stormwater
        pollutants from highway runoff. Bioswales are simply flat drainage
        ditches lined with trees, shrubs, grasses, and other vegetation. Runoff
        from the highway that is collected in gutters and drainage pipes flows
        into swales built parallel to the roadway. As water flows through grass
        and vegetation, pollutants sorb onto the surfaces of the soil and
        vegetation in the swale. In essence, the runoff is “scrubbed” as it
        flows down the swale. By the time the runoff reaches a nearby creek or
        stream, many of the stormwater pollutants have been removed.
    </p>

        Water quality engineers also design bioswales to treat runoff from
        residential, commercial, and industrial properties. Often, swales
        become part of a site’s landscaping. Bioswales are simple and
        relatively inexpensive, but they serve at least two important
        functions: they add vegetation to the site, making it more attractive,
        and they help control stormwater pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stormwater ponds are another method for removing stormwater pollutants.
        They function by first reducing the velocity of the stormwater entering
        the pond, allowing sedimentation to occur. Pollutants are also removed
        by vegetation and soil in the pond through filtration and sorption, and
        by bacteria through biodegradation. Stormwater ponds help prevent
        flooding by detaining stormwater runoff, which also prevents erosion.
    </p>
    <p>
        People have used erosion and sediment control techniques for many years
        to conserve soil. Now, we also recognize their value for keeping soil
        and other pollutants out of our waterways. Erosion and sediment control
        can be accomplished by preventing stormwater from contacting the soil,
        reducing the velocity of stormwater, stabilizing the soil, or capturing
        eroded sediments at the source.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may have seen some methods of controlling erosion and sediment used
        in your area. Ten of the most common methods are:
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ diverting stormwater runoff away from areas where the soilhas been
        disturbed;
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ planting grass and other vegetation to stabilize the soil andprevent
        it from being washed away;
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ placing burlap, coconut fiber, or synthetic mats to
        stabilizedisturbed soils and keep them in place;
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ adding cobbles and boulders, or <em>riprap</em>, to areas where the
        stormwater velocity is high—at the discharge ends of pipes, for
        instance—to keep the soils in place and reduce the erosive energy of
        the water;
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ adding gravel pads to the entrances of construction sites sosoil is
        not tracked off by vehicles entering and exiting the site;
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ placing plastic covers over disturbed or stock-piled soils tokeep
        rainwater from contacting the soil and causing erosion;
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ compacting and texturing disturbed soils carefully with
        heavyequipment to make them more resistant to erosion;
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ placing straw bales in ditches to slow down the velocity andreduce
        the energy of the stormwater;
    </p>

        />
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        Silt fences and grass stabilization at a construction site
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ placing barriers such as black plastic silt fences arounddisturbed
        areas to keep eroded soils from washing off the site; and
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ placing barriers around drains and inlets to keep soils fromwashing
        into them.
    </p>
    <p>
        A combination of these methods works best to control erosion and
        sediment. For example, at large construction sites where soil is being
        disturbed extensively, contractors typically use silt fences, straw
        bales, gravel construction entrances, and inlet barriers. They usually
        also seed the disturbed areas as soon as possible with grass and other
        vegetation to stabilize the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes communities prohibit construction activities during rainy
        periods to prevent erosion. Other times they allow construction during
        rainy periods if proper erosion control measures are being used and
        properly maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oil/water separators are devices that treat stormwater runoff from
        parking lots and other areas containing petroleum products. Although
        these devices come in many different shapes and sizes, they are all
        based on one fundamental principle: oil is lighter than water. Oil
        floats to the surface of water, where it can be removed. In some of
        these separators, stormwater passes through a concrete box containing
        baffles that remove the floating oil. In others, stormwater flows
        through a series of plates that help separate the floating oil from the
        water. Oil/water separators work best for removing concentrated
        discharges of petroleum products. They are only partially effective in
        removing petroleum products that have become dispersed throughout the
        stormwater.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vegetated filter strips, infiltration galleries, leaf-compost filters,
        and catch basin filters also remove pollutants from stormwater.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vegetated filter strips are strips of grass and other vegetation. They
        function much like bioswales—removing pollutants as water passes over
        and through them—except that they are flat, sloping strips of land
        instead of drainage channels.
    </p>
    <p>
        Infiltration galleries are pond-like areas where stormwater is
        collected and allowed to infiltrate into the soil. As the stormwater
        moves down through the soil, it is also treated through sorption and
        biodegradation. Before using infiltration galleries at a particular
        site, however, engineers should consider the potential effects on
        groundwater quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leaf-compost filters function like bioswales, except that they consist
        of densely packed leaves. The filter removes pollutants as the runoff
        flows through the leaves and the pollutants sorb and biodegrade.
    </p>
    <p>
        Catch basin filters are baskets of filter material, such as sand,
        leaves, and carbon, which are placed under stormwater inlets and
        grates. Stormwater entering a catch basin must pass through these
        baskets of material before entering the drainage system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps the biggest unknown in the practice of treating stormwater is
        what to do with the residuals retained in these various stormwater
        treatment processes. Communities must properly manage these materials
        to keep the treatment processes functioning well and to protect the
        environment. Some of the remaining pollutants may be relatively
        nontoxic and they can be used as fertilizers or soil amendments. Others
        may require treatment prior to disposal. Researchers currently are
        investigating different ways of managing stormwater treatment
        residuals.

        <strong>Domestic Treatment</strong>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Septic Systems</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        As discussed in Chapter 3, people living in rural areas commonly treat
        and dispose of their sewage by using septic systems. With these
        systems, household wastewater flows from home plumbing into a septic
        tank and drain field buried in the yard. Most of the sewage solids are
        retained in the septic tank, where they naturally decompose through
        biodegradation. Every five to ten years, nonbiodegradable solids such
        as sand and grit must be removed by having a septic contractor pump the
        tank. The liquid effluent flows out of the septic tank into a series of
        perforated drainpipes called a drain field, and then out of holes in
        the drainpipes into the underlying soil. When the system is functioning
        properly, effluent from the tank receives further treatment through
        filtration, sorption, and biodegradation as it percolates down through
        the soil. Septic systems are sometimes referred to as on-site systems
        because they are usually located on the property where the wastewater
        is generated.
    </p>
    <p>
        People sometimes use another on-site system called a mound system,
        which is similar to a septic system except that the drain field is
        located in a mound of earth built on top of the natural surface of the
        land. A pump conveys effluent from the septic tank to the mound of
        earth where treatment occurs as the liquid percolates down through the
        soil in the mound. People use mound systems in areas where using a
        regular drain field would cause water quality or human health concerns,
        such as in areas with clay soils or shallow water tables.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Sewage Treatment Plants</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Domestic wastewater from most urban areas flows from home plumbing into
        sewer pipes located under the street and then to a community’s sewage
        treatment plant. Most communities treat their sewage using a common,
        five-step process.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, the sewage flows into an area referred to as the headworks. At
        the headworks, the sewage passes through a coarse screen that removes
        miscellaneous solids that get into the sewer system, such as paper
        products, cloth, and plastics. Solids making it through the coarse
        screen are sometimes chopped and ground into smaller particles by a
        device known as a comminutor. The wastewater then passes through an
        area called a grit chamber where sand, gravel, cinders, and other
        similar solids are removed. At the headworks, a specially designed
        channel called a Parshall flume is often used to measure the flow rate
        of the incoming sewage. Alternatively, the flow rate is measured with a
        flume at the end of the treatment process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, the sewage flows into a large tank called a primary
        sedimentation basin or primary clarifier. These tanks are often
        circular and may be thirty or more feet across and fifteen or more feet
        deep. Here, the larger and heavier solids that remain in the sewage
        settle out of the solution due to gravity.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img
            width="408"
            height="271"
            src="file:///C:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image066.jpg"
        />
    </p>
    <p align="right">
        Secondary clarifier
    </p>
    <p>
        Third, the sewage—minus the removed solids—flows from the primary
        clarifier into another basin, where large paddles or brushes add air by
        vigorously mixing the wastewater. Alternatively, perforated air pipes
        on the bottom of the basin add air similar to the way a bubbler adds
        air to a fish tank. This aeration basin provides the oxygen needed by
        bacteria for biodegrading the organic materials in the sewage.
        Treatment through biodegradation in an aeration basin is simply the
        process of converting the organic waste materials in the sewage into
        new bacterial cells, carbon dioxide, and water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, the outflow from the aeration basin, consisting mainly of water
        and bacterial cells, flows into a large tank called a secondary
        clarifier. Here, the bacterial cells and other remaining solids settle
        to the bottom of the clarifier and a mechanical sweeping device
        continually removes them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the bacterial solids removed from the secondary clarifier are
        returned to the aeration basin. These solids, called activated sludge,
        help maintain an active mass of microorganisms in the aeration basin to
        promote further biodegradation. When bacterial solids are recycled in
        this manner, the entire treatment system is usually called an activated
        sludge plant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the water flows out of the secondary clarifier to a chamber or
        basin for disinfection. Most communities disinfect their wastewater by
        adding chlorine and mixing it thoroughly with the effluent. Sufficient
        time is provided in the chlorine contact chamber for the chlorine to
        kill the harmful bacteria and viruses left in the wastewater.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other methods of disinfecting wastewater are available, such as adding
        ozone or passing the treated wastewater through ultraviolet light.
        These methods of disinfection help prevent the toxic effect of chlorine
        on fish and other aquatic organisms in the receiving water.
    </p>
    <p>
        After communities treat their wastewater with this five-step process,
        they commonly discharge it into the nearest river or stream.
        Alternatively, they dispose of the treated wastewater on land using
        irrigation techniques. The treated wastewater is called effluent.

        <em>Five common steps for treating sewage.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The solid materials removed from sewage—mainly in the primary and
        secondary clarifiers—are called biosolids, or sludge. Communities must
        properly manage these solids to protect the environment and public
        health. Biosolids management includes collecting, digesting, and
        stabilizing the solids through biodegradation and pH adjustment, and
        dewatering and drying the solids before disposal. Communities dispose
        of their sludge by sending it to a landfill, burning it, or using it as
        fertilizer on certain types of land. The practice of using the
        biosolids as fertilizer is often the best disposal alternative, because
        it allows the nutrients in the biosolids to be used by vegetation
        growing on the disposal site. Biosolids application must be done
        carefully, however, at rates that allow the vegetation to use the
        nutrients properly. These rates are referred to as agricultural rates
        or agronomic rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other methods of treating municipal wastewater are adaptations of this
        basic five-step process. For instance, wastewater treatment lagoons
        also rely on this five-step process, but primary sedimentation,
        aeration, and secondary sedimentation occur in the lagoon instead of in
        separate basins. Sometimes a rock filter replaces the aeration basin.
        In this type of system, wastewater travels from the primary clarifier
        to a basin of round river rocks, usually five to ten feet deep.
        Bacteria grow on these rocks and biodegrade the wastewater as it
        trickles down through the filter. Some treatment plants use other types
        of filter media, such as wooden slats or plastic materials, in place of
        the river rocks. This type of treatment system is called a trickling
        filter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Package treatment plants, which are systems where all processes are
        contained in one package, also use the five-step process, but the
        different steps occur in separate chambers of one large tank. Small
        developments like trailer parks and resorts sometimes use these package
        plants if they are located in areas without a community sewage
        treatment system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some communities even rely on wetlands to treat their domestic
        wastewater. They turn upland areas into wetland treatment systems by
        excavating ponds and swales, planting vegetation, and supplying
        wastewater. Engineers, scientists, and the public are paying more
        attention to these constructed wetlands recently because they sometimes
        offer an aesthetic alternative to conventional mechanical treatment
        systems. <em>Constructed</em> wetlands remove pollutants through the
        processes of sedimentation, filtration, sorption, and biodegradation as
        wastewater flows through the wetland. <em>Natural</em> wetlands can
        “polish” domestic wastewater—in other words, provide additional
        treatment—following a specified level of pretreatment using other
        processes. However, natural wetlands may not always be a desirable
        alternative for treating or polishing domestic wastewater because of
        the potential harm to the vegetation and aquatic organisms in the
        wetland.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Industrial Treatment</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned previously, many industries use water in their production
        processes. To protect the environment, they must remove the pollutants
        added during production prior to discharging the water. Like
        municipalities, industries commonly use the fundamental processes of
        sedimentation, biodegradation, filtration, and sorption to remove
        pollutants, along with the processes of precipitation and
        neutralization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike municipal treatment techniques, however, which are similar from
        one community to the next, industrial treatment techniques are
        industry-specific. Treatment processes vary even within a single
        industry, depending on the nature of the pollutants found in the
        wastewater of a particular manufacturer or factory. For example,
        industries generating wastewater with high concentrations of solids and
        organics use physical processes to remove solids and biological
        processes to remove organics. Potato processors—one of many types of
        food processors—first wash the potatoes to remove soil and then rinse
        the peeled potatoes to remove starch. The water used in these processes
        acquires soil particles and starchy, organic potato wastes. This type
        of wastewater is similar to domestic wastewater, though it has a much
        higher concentration of solids and organics. Because the two
        wastewaters are similar, the treatment processes employed are similar.
        Generally, potato processors treat their wastewater to remove primary
        solids, such as soil particles and potato peels, by passing the
        wastewater through screens and allowing it to stand in sedimentation
        basins. They then remove dissolved organics by allowing bacteria to
        biodegrade the organic materials and convert them into new bacterial
        cells. Finally, they remove the secondary solids, consisting mainly of
        bacterial cells, by allowing them to settle in a secondary
        sedimentation basin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even after this level of treatment, potato-processing waters still have
        relatively high concentrations of pollutants. They usually are not
        clean enough to be discharged into surface waters. Instead, the
        industry typically discharges the treated wastewater onto land, where
        further treatment occurs as the wastewater percolates through the soil.
        As you may recall, this method of further treating and disposing of
        wastewater by applying it to land is also used for municipal wastewater
        and biosolids. It provides crops with nutrients from waste materials.
        The industry must apply these wastewaters at agronomic rates, however,
        to allow crops to fully use the nutrients. Otherwise, the nutrients
        will leach into the groundwater, possibly causing problems like nitrate
        contamination.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other industries with wastewaters containing solids and organics use
        similar treatment processes. For example, pulp and paper mills use
        screening and sedimentation to remove solids, such as wood chips and
        fibers, and biological treatment to remove organics, such as the carbon
        compounds found in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
        A variety of industries use <em>chemical</em> treatment to remove
        pollutants by employing treatment processes that rely on chemical
        reactions. For instance, industries manufacturing metals, or using
        metal components in their products, often generate wastewater with high
        concentrations of dissolved metals. To remove dissolved metals, they
        add alkaline chemicals such as sodium hydroxide to the wastewater to
        increase its pH. When the pH rises, many of the dissolved metals come
        together to form solids. The chemical reaction responsible for causing
        the dissolved metals to combine and form solids is called a
        precipitation reaction. Once formed, gravity causes these solids, which
        are called precipitates, to fall from the solution. This process, which
        occurs in a sedimentation basin, effectively removes many of the
        dissolved metals from the wastewater. After the solids settle, the pH
        of the wastewater remains high and industries then rely on another
        treatment process called neutralization to bring the water back to a
        neutral pH range.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recall from Chapter 2 that liquids with a pH of 7.0 are neutral,
        liquids with a pH less than 7.0 are acidic, and liquids with a pH
        greater than 7.0 are basic. Most natural waters have a pH ranging from
        about 6.0 to 8.5. When wastewater is either too acidic or too basic, it
        is harmful to aquatic organisms and must be neutralized prior to
        discharge in order to protect the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Acidic and basic substances neutralize each other. Industries
        neutralize acidic wastewater by adding bases and basic wastewater by
        adding acids. In the example used above, the wastewater remained basic
        after the metals were removed through the precipitation reaction. A
        metal manufacturer would neutralize this basic wastewater by adding an
        acid with a low pH, such as hydrochloric acid, and bring the pH to
        approximately 7.0. Manufacturers of rare metals, electronic equipment,
        chemicals, and pharmaceuticals are just a few of the many industries
        that use neutralization to treat their acidic or basic wastewaters.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Spill Prevention and Cleanup</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Industrial manufacturing plants have relatively constant waste streams,
        especially if they are making a single product. Once the pollutants in
        the waste streams are identified and the volume of the wastewater being
        generated is known, industries can develop good treatment processes to
        prevent and control water pollution. It is more difficult to prevent
        and control less predictable sources of water pollution, such as
        accidental spills.
    </p>
    <p>
        Spilled petroleum products and other chemicals can severely damage the
        water environment. Those people responsible for petroleum products and
        other chemicals can prevent spills and reduce their impact by following
        good planning, design, operation, and maintenance procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, storing bulk liquids like chemicals and petroleum products
        warrants special attention. These materials should be stored in strong
        vessels and inspected regularly. Moreover, bulk liquids should have
        primary containment and secondary containment, in case the first method
        fails.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondary containment is commonly provided by placing the primary
        containment vessels—steel tanks, for instance—into concrete bunkers.
        These bunkers usually consist of a concrete floor and walls, but no
        roof. They are usually designed to hold one and one-half times the
        volume of the largest tank placed in the bunker, so that if a tank
        breaks, the material stored in it will be entirely contained within the
        concrete bunker, where it can be recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vessels used to transport bulk liquids by rail and barge need secondary
        containment also. Large barges transporting bulk liquids, for example,
        usually have an additional inner hull in case the outer one breaks.
        Double-walled steel tanks are often used to transport bulk liquids by
        rail.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can also prevent spills by designing highways and railroads
        properly. Any design element that reduces the opportunity for accidents
        also reduces the likelihood of accidental spills. For instance,
        engineers typically design highways and railroads so that grades are
        not too steep and curves are not too sharp. They also design and place
        traffic signs and signals appropriately. Highway and railroad crews are
        responsible for maintaining our highways and railroads to prevent
        accidents and subsequent spills.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the United States, federal law requires Spill Prevention, Control,
        and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans for sites where petroleum products
        could potentially spill and contaminate nearby waters. SPCC plans
        include an inventory of all petroleum products showing where they are
        located and the type of storage vessel used. The plans include
        topographic information showing the direction materials would travel if
        spilled and descriptions of local soil and groundwater conditions, plus
        drawings of any natural or constructed drainage system the spilled
        materials could enter. The plans usually have figures or photos showing
        the nearest surface water and how spilled materials could enter it.
        They outline procedures for properly loading and unloading materials to
        prevent and control spills.

        SPCC plans also include procedures for responding to and cleaning up
        spills. The plans include a list of emergency contacts, such as
        qualified employees, a fire marshal, and a county sheriff, and their
        phone numbers. They contain an inventory of the type and location of
        emergency response materials such as sorbent cloth, drain plugs, saw
        dust, protective clothing, gloves, booms, and other materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        Companies can plan ahead to prevent spills by developing and
        implementing SPCC plans. Potential problem areas can be identified and
        site-specific safeguards developed to prevent spills from occurring.
        Without planning ahead, employees are left to invent their own
        procedures during an emergency, with whatever materials are on hand.

        <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This chapter outlined ways of preventing water pollution by utilizing
        the natural processes of sedimentation, biodegradation, filtration, and
        sorption. It described how municipalities and industries use these
        processes to remove pollutants in controlled settings at treatment
        plants. You learned methods to reduce water pollution caused by
        stormwater runoff.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the methods used to prevent and control water pollution were
        developed in response to the laws and regulations enacted to protect
        our water resources. These regulations have important and far-reaching
        implications. Water pollution control, then, is not only about science
        and technology. It is also about the many rules and regulations
        governing water quality protection, which is the topic of the next
        chapter.

            What rules and regulations exist for protecting our water

            it is clean and safe? Many rules and regulations have been adopted
            in the United States at the federal, state, and local level to

        This chapter summarizes the water quality regulations currently in
        place at the federal, state, and local levels. These rules are
        fundamental to our understanding of water quality and water pollution
        control in the United States. By becoming informed about the
        regulations protecting our water, we can track progress in meeting
        them. We can thoughtfully consider changes, voice our opinions, and
        work with our elected officials to ensure that their policy decisions
        help protect our water resources. These rules and regulations dictate
        many of the procedures used for water quality protection.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Federal Regulations</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The United States Congress has enacted many important federal
        regulations to protect water quality. These regulations have helped
        control water pollution and protect our drinking water. They also have
        helped us to clean up contaminated waters and protect waters that
        provide important aquatic habitat to species whose survival is in
        question.

        <em>Clean Water Act</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly known as the Clean
        Water Act (CWA), is the cornerstone of water quality legislation in the
        United States. It is not the result of a single piece of legislation.
        Rather, the current Act is a combination of federal water pollution
        control policies developed over many years. Its legislative history
        goes back over one hundred years to the

        Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The United States Congress brought
        together much of this historic water quality legislation in 1972 when
        they created Public Law 92-500, now simply called the Clean Water Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Clean Water Act consists of five separate parts, called Titles.
        Title I is the introductory section, which declares the goals and
        policies of the Act. According to Title I:
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>
            The objective of this Act is to restore and maintain the chemical,
            physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Clean Water Act also establishes the goal of making the nation’s
        waters fishable and swimmable. Title I also includes descriptions of
        research and other related programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Title II includes a description of the grants program for constructing
        publicly owned treatment works. This program was responsible for
        providing funding to construct many of the municipally owned sewage
        treatment plants in the United States. It provided much of the
        financial incentive for many of the major sewerage projects constructed
        from 1972 to 1987. In 1987, the Clean Water Act was amended to phase
        out the grant program, which was replaced with a revolving fund,
        low-interest loan program. The loan program is being administered by
        individual states that receive federal matching funds. Title II also
        includes a description of the river basin planning program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Title III of the Clean Water Act is the section on water quality
        standards and enforcement measures. Standards are the reference values
        by which we judge the quality of our waters. Individual state water
        quality agencies typically develop these standards and submit them to
        the Environmental Protection Agency for review and approval. Because of
        their importance, water quality standards appear in more detail under
        the heading of <strong>State Regulations </strong>later in this
        chapter. Title III also includes a description of programs for
        developing effluent limitations, reviewing water quality conditions,
        preventing the discharge of oil and hazardous substances, and
        maintaining clean lakes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Section 305(b) of Title III includes the procedures for reviewing or
        inventorying water quality conditions. Every two years, State agencies
        inventory the quality of waters in their state and submit a summary
        report to the Environmental Protection Agency. This 305(b) report is a
        valuable reference for citizens who are concerned about the status of
        water quality in their state. It includes an inventory of polluted
        waters and the suspected sources of contamination. It also describes
        the efforts being made to improve the quality of these waters. You can
        usually obtain copies by contacting the agency responsible for water
        quality control in your state, or by visiting their web site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the policies and procedures for preventing oil pollution in
        United States’ waters are outlined under Section 311 of Title
    </p>
    <p>
        III. According to Section 311,
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>
            The Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of the United
            States that there should be no discharges of oil or hazardous
            substances into or upon the navigable waters of the United States,
            adjoining shorelines, or into or upon the waters of the contiguous
            zone.
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Section 311 requires a National Contingency Plan to be developed for
        the removal of spilled oil and hazardous substances. The purpose of the
        plan is to provide an efficient and effective course of action for
        oil-spill emergencies in order to minimize damage to the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another program outlined under Section 311 requires owners of sites
        containing petroleum products to prepare and implement spill
        prevention, control, and countermeasure plans for these sites. As
        discussed in the last chapter, SPCC plans outline the procedures to be
        followed to prevent spills from occurring and to respond effectively if
        they do. Those people responsible for sites where petroleum products
        could reasonably be expected to contaminate waters if spilled must
prepare these spill contingency plans. (See        <strong>Spill Prevention and Cleanup</strong> in Chapter 4.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Title IV of the Clean Water Act contains programs for water quality
        permits and licenses, including three you may have heard about: 1) the
        National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting
        program, 2) the dredge and fill permitting program, and 3) the Water
        Quality Certification program. (See <strong>State Regulations</strong>
        later in this chapter.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, Title V includes the other general provisions of the Act.
        These provisions include administrative procedures, definitions, and
        methods for procurement. Section 505 describes the procedures that an
        individual citizen can take to file a civil suit against any entity,
        including the government, for violating terms of the Clean Water Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes regulators and other professionals refer to water quality
        programs by their numbers and it may seem intimidating. However, these
        numbers simply refer to the sections of the Clean Water Act where the
        programs are defined. For example, the 305(b) report is defined in
        Section 305(b) of the Act, the Section 404 rules for fill and removal
        of soil in wetlands are defined in Section 404, the 401 Certification
        Process is described in Section 401, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Safe Drinking Water Act</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is the key piece of legislation that
        protects our drinking water. Congress originally passed the SDWA in
        1974 to protect public health by keeping our drinking water free from
        contamination, and it has been amended several times over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Safe Drinking Water Act defines the maximum concentrations of
        contaminants allowed in our drinking water. It defines the maximum
        contaminant levels (MCLs) for inorganic substances, organic substances,
        and microorganisms. For example, the MCL for nitrate, an inorganic
        substance, is ten parts per million. The MCL for benzene, an organic
        substance, is 0.005 parts per million. The MCL for coliform bacteria
        allows only one water sample per month to test positive for total
        coliforms when fewer than forty samples are taken per month. Chapter 7
        contains a list of the MCLs for other drinking water contaminants.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img
            width="310"

        />
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        Salmon Street Springs, Portland, Oregon
    </p>
    <p>
        The Environmental Protection Agency sets these contaminant levels after
        reviewing the findings of scientific studies and evaluating public
        comments. They consider water to be safe to drink when the
        concentrations of contaminants are below the adopted MCLs. The EPA
        routinely reviews MCLs in light of ongoing research. They present any
        proposed changes or additions to MCLs to the scientific community and
        the public before adopting new standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the important additions included in the 1986 amendments to the
        SDWA was a strict schedule for regulating additional contaminants. This
        schedule required the EPA to increase the number of regulated
        contaminants from 23 in 1986 to 112 in 1995.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SDWA requires all communities to adequately test their drinking
        water for the regulated contaminants. It specifies which contaminants
        must be tested for and defines the required frequency, the number of
        samples to be taken, and the specific techniques acceptable for
        conducting the analyses. Only approved laboratories are allowed to
        perform most of the analyses required by the SDWA. Individual state
        health departments are usually responsible for the laboratory approval
        process.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Safe Drinking Water Act regulates surface and groundwater sources
        of drinking water differently. For example, surface water sources
        generally have more stringent treatment requirements than groundwater
        sources. Water providers must typically both filter and disinfect
        surface water sources before delivering the drinking water to the
        consumer. They may only need to disinfect some groundwater sources.
        This approach has been adopted because groundwater sources are usually
        less susceptible to contamination because they are below the land
        surface, where most pollution occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of the concern over the health effects of lead and copper, the
        Safe Drinking Water Act requires communities to review their water
        distribution systems to evaluate pipe materials and report this
        information to the agency responsible for drinking water in their
        state. Lead contamination can originate from pipes, from solder and
        interior linings used on the distribution mains, or from home plumbing.
        Copper contamination can originate from alloys used in distribution
        mains or home plumbing. The 1986 amendments to the SDWA prohibit the
        use of lead pipes, solder, or flux in drinking water systems. State and
        local plumbing codes enforce this prohibition. Chapter 7 contains more
        information about copper and lead in drinking water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Drinking water providers must notify the public if the maximum
        contaminant levels established in the SDWA are exceeded in a
        community’s drinking water supply. The providers must publish the
        violation in a daily newspaper circulated in the area served by the
        water system. They also must report the violation by direct mail—in
        their monthly water bill, for example. If the violation poses an
        immediate threat to public health, they must announce the problem by
        radio and television. The water provider must also notify the public of
        the action being taken and the anticipated schedule for addressing the
        problem.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>National Environmental Policy Act</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The United States Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act
        (NEPA) in 1969. It was one of the first pieces of legislation in the
        United States to specifically address protection of the whole
        environment—air, land, and water—and the organisms living in them,
        including humans. NEPA is also directed at protecting the socioeconomic
        environment, and cultural and historic resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of NEPA is to evaluate the environmental impacts of all
        activities sponsored by the federal government. According to NEPA, the
        proponents of projects that involve federal funding or other federal
        interest must complete environmental reviews and prepare environmental
        documents to evaluate their proposed action and reasonable
        alternatives, and the environmental consequences of each.
    </p>
    <p>
        These environmental documents take the form of either an Environmental
        Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), depending
        on the expected level of environmental effects. NEPA requires an EA
        when the effects of the proposed action are not expected to be
        significant, according to the federal definition. NEPA requires an EIS
        when the impacts are expected to be large, far-reaching, or significant
        in other ways.
    </p>
    <p>
        The National Environmental Policy Act opens the door on the federal
        decision-making process. It provides the means for involving state and
        local agencies and the public in all federal decisions affecting the
        environment. Decisions at the state and local level may also be subject
        to NEPA. For example, if a community secures federal money for an
        activity with environmental concerns, such as highway construction,
        that project is subject to a NEPA review.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the common misconceptions about Environmental Impact Statements
        is the role they play in stopping a project. An EIS will not
        necessarily stop an unwise project, even though one of the alternatives
        evaluated in the EIS is the “No-Action” Alternative. The EIS process
        provides the public with an opportunity to participate in the
        environmental review. It ensures that the project proponent reviews the
        environmental

        consequences of a proposed action and alternatives and makes this
        information available to the public and federal decisionmakers. The
        NEPA process provides no assurance, however, that the decision-makers
        will choose wisely. It ensures only that federal activities affecting
        the environment proceed in an informed and organized way through an
        open public process.

        Although individual federal agencies develop their own methods for
        implementing NEPA, within specific guidelines, the basic procedures are
        essentially the same. The NEPA process consists of preparing the
        environmental document, issuing a draft document for review and
        comment, revising the document if necessary, issuing a revised final
        document for review and comment, and rendering a decision based on the
        final environmental document and review comments.

        <em>Endangered Species Act</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Congress passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973. It was the
        first powerful piece of legislation to recognize the inherent value of
        the many different life forms in the environment and establish
        regulations to protect them. Originally, the ESA listed only 109
        species of plants and animals as threatened or endangered. Today, the
        list has grown to about 900—or 1,400 if species found internationally
        are included. The ESA requires special protection measures for species
        listed as threatened or endangered, and their habitat. The United
        States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries
        Service are the two federal agencies chiefly responsible for
        implementing the ESA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two success stories provide examples of the ESA’s value in saving
        threatened and endangered species. In the 1960s, only 400 breeding
        pairs of bald eagles existed in the United States’ lower 48 states. The
        ESA helped force a ban on the use of the herbicide DDT, which had been
        found to be responsible for weakening egg shells and causing eagle
        mortality. The number of breeding pairs has now increased to 4,000 or
        more. The bald eagle moved from the threatened to the endangered list
        in June of 1994. Likewise, the California gray whale is no longer a
        threatened or endangered species. Federal agencies removed the
        California gray whale from the threatened and endangered list
        completely in June of 1994. The number of gray whales has grown from a
        historic low of a few thousand to about 24,000 today, due in part to
        protection provided under the ESA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although you may not think of it in this way initially, the Endangered
        Species Act is a form of water quality legislation. In fact, the ESA’s
        list of threatened and endangered species contains more aquatic plants
        and animals than land-dwelling ones. Since all aquatic species need
        clean water for survival, the ESA provides a regulatory basis for
        protecting water quality where these species are threatened or
        endangered.
    </p>
    <p>
        When other environmental laws, such as the Clean Water Act and the
        National Environmental Policy Act, are not sufficient to protect both
        the water and the species dependent on it, then the ESA becomes an
        important water quality regulation. The plight of salmon in the Pacific
        Northwest is a good example of the ESA acting to protect aquatic
        species and water quality. The salmon populations in the Northwest have
        declined drastically over the past twenty years, causing several
        species to be placed on the ESA’s endangered and threatened species
        list. For instance, the Snake River sockeye salmon and spring/summer
        Chinook salmon were listed as endangered in 1991 and 1994,
        respectively. To help these endangered species, the National Marine
        Fisheries Service has developed a recovery plan, as required by the
        ESA. The recovery plan includes provisions to improve fish habitat by
        protecting watersheds, stream corridors, and water quality.

    <p align="left">
        <em>Hazardous Waste Regulations</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The United States Congress has enacted several laws to help prevent
        hazardous wastes from damaging the environment and harming public
        health. Two of the most focused laws are the Resource Conservation and
        Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
        Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund
        Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        Congress enacted RCRA in 1976. Its primary purpose is to ensure that
        hazardous wastes are managed properly from the time they are generated
        until they are ultimately disposed of or destroyed. This lifetime
        management approach is often referred to as the cradle-to-grave
        concept.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to RCRA, wastes are hazardous if EPA evaluates them and lists
        them as such, or if they are ignitable, corrosive, or reactive to
        certain test substances. Wastes are also hazardous according to RCRA if
        they cause toxicity in a special test called the Toxicity
        Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP).
    </p>
    <p>
        Congress modified RCRA in 1984 with the Hazardous and Solid Waste
        Amendment, giving EPA and the states additional authority to regulate
        the disposal practices of hazardous waste generators.
    </p>
    <p>
        The amendment established three distinct categories of hazardous waste
        generators:
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ Large Quantity Generators, which are those facilitiesgenerating more
        than 2.2 pounds (one kilogram) of acute hazardous waste or more than
        2,200 pounds (about five 55-gallon drums) of any hazardous waste;
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ Small Quantity Generators, defined as facilities generatingbetween
        220 and 2,200 pounds of hazardous waste; and
    </p>
    <p>
        ✔ Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators, whichgenerate less
        than 220 pounds of hazardous waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        RCRA regulations require hazardous waste generators to properly
        inventory, label, store, transport, and dispose of hazardous wastes and
        implement methods to minimize the creation of wastes. Facilities that
        are conditionally exempt under RCRA are often regulated under other
        programs, such as state regulations for solid waste.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although RCRA has been successful in helping to manage the generation
        and proper disposal of hazardous wastes, it has not been effective in
        cleaning up abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste disposal sites.
        You may have heard about Love Canal, a site in New York State that
        received extensive press coverage during the 1970s. At Love Canal, a
        developer built new homes in an area contaminated with hazardous wastes
        that had been buried twentyfive years earlier. This abandoned disposal
        site was responsible for contaminating the area’s streams, soil, and
        groundwater. Some residents, fearful of how the hazardous wastes would
        affect their health, moved away from the area and filed lawsuits.
        Authorities had to evacuate others for their own safety.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1980, the United States Congress enacted Superfund in response to
        the problems caused by abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites like
        Love Canal. The Superfund regulations outline a program for discovering
        abandoned or uncontrolled sites, evaluating the levels and types of
        contamination, and cleaning up the sites. They also outline an
        extensive environmental liability program to hold those responsible for
        the contamination accountable for damages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under Superfund, the Environmental Protection Agency developed the
        National Priority List, which targeted more than 1,200 sites across the
        country for evaluation and cleanup. Some of these sites are now clean
        and others are not.
    </p>
    <p>
        Superfund has been less effective than originally envisioned for two
        primary reasons. First, it is extremely expensive to clean up these
        abandoned disposal sites. It often costs several million dollars to
        evaluate the contamination and develop alternatives for remedial
        action, and then several million more to actually clean up a single
        site. Second, the regulators and the parties responsible for the
        contaminated sites have found it difficult to agree on how clean the
        sites need to be in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although RCRA and Superfund are both land- and publichealth-based
        regulations, they play an important role in protecting water quality.
        RCRA helps to prevent waters from being contaminated by hazardous
        substances in the first place, and Superfund helps to clean up
        sites—including surface and ground waters—that have become
        contaminated.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>State Regulations</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In many cases, federal agencies have delegated responsibility for
        implementation of federal water quality regulations to the states. For
        example, state agencies often administer at least three federal
        programs established under the Clean Water Act: the National Pollutant
        Discharge Elimination System program, the water quality standards
        program, and the water quality certification program. Generally, both
        state and federal agencies participate in implementing wetland fill and
        removal regulations.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Section 402 of the Clean Water Act authorizes the National Pollutant
        Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program. Although
        federally mandated, the EPA typically delegates the program to
        individual state water quality agencies for implementation. States use
        the NPDES program to regulate the discharge of industrial wastewater,
        municipal wastewater, and
    </p>

    <p align="right">

    </p>
    <p>
        stormwater. NPDES permits are required for almost all industrial and
        municipal discharges and some stormwater discharges.
    </p>
    <p>
        NPDES permits consist of four parts, commonly called schedules, and a
        set of General Conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Schedule A of the permit outlines the discharge limitations. For
        instance, municipal sewage treatment plants typically cannot discharge
        more than thirty parts per million of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
        or thirty parts per million of total suspended solids (TSS). These are
        referred to as the 30/30 Discharge Limitations. They define the level
        of treatment required by municipalities prior to discharging treated
        wastewater.
    </p>
    <p>
        Schedule B of the permit defines the monitoring requirements, detailing
        the frequency of sampling and the type of analyses to be performed.
        Schedule B may require a municipality to measure temperature and pH on
        a daily basis and BOD and TSS on a weekly basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Schedule C includes the compliance conditions and schedules to be met
        by the permitted facility. For example, treatment plant operators may
        need to complete a special study to improve the performance of the
        treatment plant. Schedule C would outline a mandatory program and
        schedule for performing this study.
    </p>
    <p>
        Special conditions are outlined in Schedule D. These conditions may
        include special requirements for monitoring biota (a process called
        biomonitoring), training staff, and operating and maintaining the
        facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final elements of the permit are outlined in the General
        Conditions, which includes specific procedures for managing data and
        records, definitions of terms, and penalties for violations of the
        permit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dischargers must renew their NPDES permits every five years. During the
        renewal period, staff from the state agency issuing the permit
        completes an evaluation report and drafts a new permit. Individuals
        have the greatest opportunity to participate in the permitting process
        at this time. Once the agency drafts the new permit and the applicant
        reviews it, the agency releases it for public review and comment. Prior
        to issuing the permit, agency staff must evaluate comments received
        during the public review period. Often, they schedule a public hearing
        to allow individuals to express their opinions about the permit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Permit holders that do not meet the terms of the permit are subject to
        fines and penalties, usually based upon the degree and frequency of the
        violation. State agencies can also revoke permits. Under the Clean
        Water Act, the permit holder may discharge properly treated wastewater
        as a privilege, not a right. State and federal regulators can deny this
        privilege with just cause.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Water Quality Standards</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Water quality standards are the numeric values or statements that
        define the acceptable characteristics of our waters and they give us a
        frame of reference for protecting their quality. For example, to
        prevent our waters from becoming too acidic or alkaline, states have
        adopted water quality standards for pH. Although standards may vary
        slightly from one state to another, a typical standard would require
        the pH of a particular water body to be within the range of about 6.0
        to 8.5—neither too acidic nor too basic. Most states have adopted water
        quality standards for temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity,
        bacteria, solids, and toxic substances. Most standards are numeric
        values, but some are simply statements called narrative standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although federally mandated by Section 303 of the Clean Water Act, the
        process of adopting standards is performed by individual state
        agencies. Presumably, state agencies are in a better position to set
        state standards than the federal government, since they know more about
        the quality and uses of waters in their state.
    </p>
    <p>
        When establishing water quality standards, state agencies must consider
how water bodies are used. Regulators use the term <em>beneficial</em>        <em>use</em> to describe the kind of activities that a particular water
        body is targeted for, which helps dictate the desired quality of that
        water body. Beneficial uses include the following: domestic and
        industrial water supply, water contact recreation such as swimming or
        wading, resident fish and aquatic life, irrigation, fishing, boating,
        anadromous fish passage, aesthetic quality, and hydroelectric power.
        For instance, if fish and aquatic life are recognized as beneficial
        uses in a particular water body, the state must set the water quality
        standards in that water body at levels that support fish and aquatic
        life.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Environmental Protection Agency assists individual states in
        developing water quality standards, as specified in the Clean Water
        Act. EPA publishes Quality Criteria for Water, a document
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img
            width="408"

    </p>
    <p>
        that describes the recommended values for specific water quality
        standards based on scientific studies. EPA first published Quality
        Criteria for Water in 1976 and now publishes it about every ten years.
        The 1976 version is often called the “Red Book” and the 1986 version is
        called the “Gold Book” because of the colors of their covers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Municipal and industrial dischargers must not cause water quality
        standards to be violated in the streams receiving their discharge. They
        must properly treat their wastewater prior to discharge to achieve this
        end. In some states, dischargers are allowed a small area in the stream
        for mixing of effluent prior to meeting water quality standards. This
        area, called a mixing zone, is defined in the discharger’s NPDES
        permit. For example, a typical mixing zone could be defined as that
        area within a one hundredfoot radius from the point of discharge. Water
        quality standards— except for acute toxicity—are suspended within the
        mixing zone, but they must be met at its boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
        A water body is water quality limited when it does not meet a water
        quality standard or support recognized beneficial uses. Since this
        condition is not allowable under the Clean Water Act, states must take
        action to bring the water body back into compliance with the standard.
        As a rule, staff from the responsible state water quality agency
        performs studies to determine the cause of the violation. If the
        condition is caused by discharges into the water body, states limit
        these discharges through a process of establishing the total maximum
        daily load (TMDL), waste load allocations (WLAs), and load allocations
        (LAs). The TMDL is the total amount of a pollutant that can be
        discharged into the water body without causing an in-stream violation
        of the applicable water quality standard. The waste load allocations
        and load allocations are the quantities of pollutant that the
        respective point and nonpoint sources are allowed to discharge while
        meeting water quality standards. The TMDL consists of these allocations
        plus an amount set aside for reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
        The public has the opportunity to become involved in the process of
        controlling discharges to water quality limited waters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Agency staff first develops a draft plan outlining how discharges will
        be reduced to achieve compliance with the standard. They then circulate
        this plan to the public and to special interest groups for review and
        comment. Agencies usually schedule a public hearing to give interested
        people the opportunity to comment on the proposed plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also get involved in the periodic review of state water quality
        standards. According to the Clean Water Act, water quality standards
        must be reviewed every three years and the review process must be open
        to the public. You can request the draft standards from your state’s
        environmental agency, review them, and express your views at scheduled
        public meetings or submit your comments in writing. You can call your
        state water quality agency or check their web site to learn about
        opportunities for public review and comment on water quality standards
        and TMDL studies.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Water Quality Certification</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        State water quality agencies must certify that activities subject to
        federal agency permits or licenses are in compliance with state water
        quality regulations. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires this
        procedure, commonly referred to as the 401 Certification process. For
        example, a dam operator must secure a license from the Federal Energy
        Regulatory Commission (FERC) to construct and operate a power
        generating dam. The state water quality agency must review this
        proposed activity and issue a 401 Certification—also called Water
        Quality Certification—before FERC can issue a license to the dam
        operator.
    </p>
    <p>
        To request certification, an applicant prepares a plan that describes
        the project and its potential effects on water quality and submits it
        to the state agency. Based on the information in the plan, and
        compliance with state water quality standards and regulations, the
        state can approve or deny the request.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Wetlands Protection</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned in Chapter 2, wetlands are disappearing rapidly throughout
        the world. Fortunately, we have slowed the rate of loss in the United
        States by enacting wetland protection regulations at all levels of
        government.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most commonly applied regulatory programs, administered by
        the United States Army Corps of Engineers, is the wetland permitting
        program. In 1972, Congress codified these regulations in Section 404 of
        the Clean Water Act. Before anyone can legally discharge dredged or
        fill materials into waters of the United States—which includes most
        wetlands—they must obtain a Section 404 permit from the Corps. The
        Corps issues these permits based on the merits of the application and
        compliance with Section 404 regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, because this is a federal permitting program, the state where
        the activity is planned must also certify that it will not cause
        violations of state water quality standards, as required by Section 401
        of the Clean Water Act.
    </p>
    <p>
        In many states, land boards and similar agencies are also involved in
        regulating wetlands. For example, the Oregon Division of State Lands
        works with the Corps to implement both federal and state
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img

    <p>
        wetland protection regulations. If a person proposes to remove, fill,
        or alter more than fifty cubic yards of material within state waters,
        including wetlands, they must obtain a permit from the Division of
        State Lands and/or the Corps. These two agencies have worked together
        to develop a single permit application form that the applicant
        completes and submits to both entities.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the practical difficulties in implementing wetland regulations
        is determining what constitutes a wetland. Is a wetland always a wet,
        swampy area? The short answer is no. Wetlands come in many varieties
        and go by different common and scientific names: bogs, swamps, marshes,
        emergent wetlands, forested wetlands, wet meadows, saltwater marshes,
        wooded swamps, scrubshrub wetlands, riparian or shoreline wetlands, and
        so forth. According to the federal regulations implementing Section 404
        of the Clean Water Act, wetlands are:
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>
            Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground
            water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that
            under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation
            typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Wetland scientists commonly use three criteria to identify and
        determine the boundaries of wetlands: 1) hydrology, which is the
        absence or presence of water, 2) the occurrence of wetland plant
        species, called<em> </em>hydrophytes, and 3) the existence of hydric
        soils. The Corps has developed a special federal manual to assist
        scientists in correctly identifying wetlands.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1977, President Carter issued Executive Order 1190 to prevent
        wetlands from being harmed by federal activities. This order directs
        federal agencies to avoid activities that harm wetlands unless there
        are no practicable alternatives. The order states in part:
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>
            Each agency, to the extent permitted by law, shall avoid
            undertaking or providing assistance for new construction located in
            wetlands unless the head of the agency finds that 1) there is not a
            practicable alternative to such construction and 2) the proposed
            action includes all practicable measures to minimize harm to
            wetlands which may result from such use.
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1986, Congress enacted the Emergency Wetlands Resource Act. This act
        requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through staff of the
        United States Fish and Wildlife Service, to evaluate and report on the
        status and trends of wetlands in the United States every ten years or
        so. These ten-year reports give us a broad look at our wetlands and
        they have not painted an encouraging picture. We are continuing to lose
        wetlands and their valuable water quality benefits in spite of state
        and federal wetland protection regulations.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>State Environmental Policy Act</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Other environmental policies, such as the State Environmental Policy
        Act (SEPA), do not focus on protecting individual components of the
        environment like wetlands. Rather, their aim is to protect the entire
        natural and human environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some states have a process for reviewing the environmental impacts of
        actions taken at the state and local level. This process generally
        follows the same basic approach as NEPA. In fact, sometimes these state
        regulations are affectionately referred to as “baby NEPA” requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most SEPAs require a project sponsor to describe the proposed action
        and its alternatives, and summarize expected environmental effects.
        Some jurisdictions have streamlined this review process by developing
        an environmental checklist or questionnaire. Regardless of their
        format, however, these state environmental reviews always include an
        evaluation of the proposed project’s effect on water quality.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Local Regulations</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to state and federal programs, local programs have been
        developed to protect water quality in our communities. Sometimes these
        local programs seem especially pertinent because they focus on problems
        closer to home.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Construction Related Ordinances</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Cities and counties often adopt special ordinances to protect local
        waters from construction-related problems. For example, many of them
        have adopted ordinances to keep soils and construction materials from
        entering waters near construction sites. These ordinances require
        erosion control features such as sediment fences, inlet protection,
        gravel entrance pads, and revegetation to be designed into a project
        and shown on the construction drawings. They also require construction
        contractors to maintain these erosion control features and manage their
        building materials properly. Contractors must keep the erosion control
        measures in good working order, since many jurisdictions inspect
        construction sites for compliance. Local agencies can revoke building
        permits if the builder does not comply with these erosion control and
        materials management ordinances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes water quality protection measures are associated with land
        use approvals. In areas with strict land use laws, for instance, the
        local land use authority must review and approve proposed projects
        before developers can move forward. The project sponsor may be required
        to identify potential water quality impacts as part of the land use
        approval process. Sponsors usually must develop plans to eliminate or
        minimize these impacts before the project is approved.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most local jurisdictions have flood plain ordinances intended to
        prevent flooding that also benefit water quality. These ordinances are
        often modeled after guidelines established by the Federal Emergency
        Management Agency (FEMA). By following FEMA guidelines, communities are
        allowed to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program, making
        them eligible to receive federal assistance if a flood occurs. These
        ordinances also serve to protect water quality by preventing flood
        plains from being randomly developed and disturbed. The vegetation and
        soils in the flood plains, and adjacent wetlands, provide important
        water quality benefits. They remove pollutants from waters passing
        through them. Vegetation also benefits water quality by shading the
        water, keeping it cool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some local jurisdictions require proposed construction projects to be
        reviewed during the design phase of the project. During this
        design-phase review, city or county staff may require design
        modifications to prevent the project from harming water quality.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Special District Ordinances</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Communities sometimes form special service districts to address
        specific water quality concerns. Unlike cities and counties, whose
        responsibilities include everything from roads and parks to schools and
        fire protection, these special districts have limited obligations.
        Their efforts often can be focused at managing water quality in a
        single body of water, or in a body of water and its tributaries.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, in Lincoln City, Oregon, the Devils Lake Water Improvement
        District was formed to help address the specific water quality problems
        of Devils Lake. Because the lake suffers from an abundance of aquatic
        weeds, the district’s staff developed a novel, site-specific program to
        control weeds. They introduced a nonreproductive species of weed-eating
        fish into the lake. They also routinely monitor the water chemistry of
        the lake to evaluate the effect of their lake restoration activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        A special governmental body in the Seattle, Washington area, called the
        Puget Sound Water Quality Authority, helps maintain and restore the
        quality of the water and other natural resources in Puget Sound and its
        tributaries. This group works with cities, counties, state agencies,
        and the public to accomplish its mission.
    </p>
    <p>
        These special districts provide technical and managerial guidance about
        water quality to the public and local jurisdictions. They may publish
        technical guidance manuals and model ordinances. In some cases, they
        may have the authority to develop and implement their own rules and
        regulations such as ordinances for controlling erosion, stormwater
        runoff, and other sources of water pollution. One of these special
        service districts may exist in your area. If so, you may want to give
        them a call. They will likely provide you with useful information about
        water quality issues and concerns in your community.

        Even with our many federal, state, and local rules and regulations,
        some of our attempts to restore and maintain the quality of our waters
        have fallen short of the mark. Some of the waters in the United States
        are still polluted in spite of our continued efforts to control
        individual sources of pollution. The next chapter introduces you to
        watershed management, a way of thinking more broadly about water
        quality protection.

            Over the past thirty years, the United States has made a great deal
            of progress in reducing water pollution from municipal and
            industrial point source discharges. We are also starting to make
            progress in controlling more diffuse, nonpoint sources of water
            pollution, such as stormwater runoff. Yet, even with our efforts
            and accomplishments, many of the nation’s waters have not met the
            fishable and swimmable goals of the Clean Water Act. Why are some
            of our waters still polluted? Why were some of our earlier efforts

        Many of our water pollution control efforts have been scattered and
        disconnected because we have focused on individual scenes rather than
        the big picture. If we were doctors, we might be accused of
        concentrating on fixing individual ailments instead of attending to the
        total health of our patient. A new, broader approach to water pollution
        control is emerging to overcome some of the shortcomings of our earlier
        efforts. This new approach focuses our water quality and water
        pollution control efforts in watersheds.

        Washington
    </p>
    <p>
        What is a watershed? It is essentially a drainage basin. You can think
        of it like a kitchen bowl or basin, but on a much larger scale. If you
        fill a kitchen basin with water and then make a hole in its bottom, all
        of the water in the basin will run “downhill” and drain out of the
        hole. Similarly, a drainage basin or watershed is a large basin of
        land. When rain falls into the basin, all the runoff will run downhill
        and drain to the river, stream, or lake at the bottom of the basin. For
        example, the Columbia River watershed is the portion of land that
        drains into the Columbia River. It stretches from British Columbia to
        the Pacific Ocean and includes parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and
        Montana. All precipitation falling into this basin eventually enters
        the Columbia River through surface or groundwater flow and ultimately
        drains into the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, all activities occurring
        within this watershed can affect water quality in the Columbia River.
    </p>
    <p>
        Individual tributaries of larger rivers have their own watersheds. For
        instance, in Wisconsin, the Namekagon River watershed consists of all
        the lands draining into it. Since the Namekagon is a tributary of the
        St. Croix River, its watershed is also part of the larger St. Croix
        River watershed. Both of these rivers are tributaries of the
        Mississippi River and their watersheds are part of the huge Mississippi
        River watershed. We call these smaller watersheds within larger
        watersheds subwatersheds or subbasins.
    </p>
    <p>
        Watersheds begin at mountaintops or ridges and they extend to the
        points of lowest elevation in the basin. Precipitation falling in a
        watershed flows downhill from the mountaintops and ridges— the upper
        boundaries of the watershed—to the streams and lowlands below.
        Watersheds are made up of all the landforms, vegetation, organisms, and
        water bodies in the basin. They may consist of uplands, lowlands, areas
        above and below timberline, forested areas, agricultural areas, urban
        areas, streams, wetlands, lakes, estuaries, and all the organisms
        living in these areas.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img
            width="407"

            src="file:///C:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image090.gif"
        />
    </p>
    <p>
        A watershed is a well-defined area for directing water pollution
        control efforts because all activities occurring within it have the
        potential for affecting water quality in that basin. Activities such as
        logging, farming, road building, mining, home construction, and others
        can affect water quality. Natural events occurring in a watershed, such
        as forest fires, land slides, flooding, and erosion also influence
        water quality. Activities occurring at any given point in the basin
        have the potential for reducing the quality of the waters downstream.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the past, we focused many of our water pollution control efforts on
        individual sources of pollution, such as municipal or industrial
        discharges. With the new watershed approach, we evaluate all sources of
        pollution in a watershed collectively. That way, the benefits gained by
        strict control of point source discharges are not undone by pollution
        from other sources elsewhere in the watershed. This approach allows us
        to direct our water pollution control efforts within the watershed in
        ways that achieve the greatest benefit for the least cost. Our efforts
        can focus on achieving total watershed health, not just health in one
        part of the system. Moreover, we can evaluate the results of individual
        and combined efforts in light of the overall goal of achieving a
        healthy watershed system.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the many positive outcomes of evaluating water quality from a
        watershed perspective is the increased opportunity for public
        involvement. Local residents can assist engineers, scientists, and
        other environmental professionals in studying the watershed and fixing
        problem areas. Residents can get involved in everything from collecting
        water quality samples to planting trees along streams to provide shade
        and prevent erosion. By being involved, they develop a sense of
        stewardship for their own watersheds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you know what watershed you live in? You can answer this question by
        looking at a map and finding the nearest creek that would receive
        runoff from your property. Then, follow this creek to where it enters
        the next largest stream or river and so forth. These creeks and rivers
        and the basins of land that drain into them are your watershed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The remainder of this chapter summarizes the typical steps involved in
        using the watershed approach for protecting water quality. In its
        simplest terms, this approach consists of characterizing the watershed,
        identifying activities that influence water quality in the basin,
        developing alternatives to address problems, selecting and implementing
        the best alternatives, and monitoring the watershed to determine the
        results of water quality improvement efforts.

        <strong>Watershed Characteristics</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand the overall water quality picture, investigators studying
        the watershed must first determine some of its physical, chemical, and
        biological characteristics. They define many of the physical
        characteristics of a watershed by answering the following questions:
        How large is the watershed? What are its boundaries? What type of
        terrain exists in the watershed? What is the geology of the area? Where
        are the streams located? Do lakes or ponds exist in the watershed? Do
        wetlands exist? What temperature are the waters? Are the banks of the
        streams in good condition, or are they eroding?
    </p>
    <p>
        A review of a watershed’s physical characteristics may also include
        evaluating information about the climate: such as precipitation,
        evaporation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chemical characteristics of the watershed include the chemical
        makeup of all important water bodies in the watershed— rivers, streams,
        lakes, wetlands, estuaries, and so forth. Investigators determine these
        characteristics by measuring water quality parameters, such as
        dissolved oxygen, pH, organics, solids, nutrients, and toxics. The
        mineral makeup of the soils also may be included as part of the
        chemical characterization of the watershed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The biological characterization consists of an inventory of the plants
        and animals in the watershed, particularly aquatic plants and animals.
        The characterization identifies and evaluates sensitive species such as
        those that are threatened or endangered. For instance, the inventory
        may include a list of salmon spawning areas and an estimated count of
        the number of salmon returning to these spawning areas during the
        review period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, many groups are using computerized data management systems
        called geographic information systems (GISs) to inventory the physical,
        chemical, and biological characteristics of watersheds. These systems
        allow users to store important data about the watershed in the computer
        and relate that information to its geographic position within the
        watershed. For example, after inventorying soils, researchers can enter
        soil types into the GIS according to their location in the watershed.
        The GIS allows them to generate a map of the watershed showing where
        the individual soil groups exist. Researchers also can review other
        important information about soil groups, such as their chemical
        structures and textures. They can do the same thing with water bodies
        and other features in the watershed. This method of managing data
        geographically helps those studying the watershed to visualize the
        connections between the different types of information, such as soils
        and water quality, or habitat and wildlife.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Activities Affecting Water Quality</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step for investigators in evaluating the watershed is to
        identify the various activities affecting water quality. These
        activities are generally associated with land uses within the watershed
        and individual actions associated with such use. For example, land uses
        include forestry, agriculture, industry, and urban development.
        Individual actions might include include logging, application of
        pesticides and fertilizers, industrial discharges, municipal
        discharges, and construction projects such as road and home building.
        Chapter 3 includes descriptions of these and other possible sources of
        water pollution in more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        These land uses and individual actions are typically shown on a map of
        the watershed, such as those produced by a GIS. This type of map gives
        those studying the watershed a sense of space and geography. It helps
        to identify problem areas, develop restoration alternatives, and
        implement monitoring efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Natural events like changes in climate, forest fires, flooding, and
        erosion also affect water quality. These natural events usually are
        beyond anyone’s control, but those studying the watershed generally
        document their occurrence and take them into consideration in their
        overall evaluation of impacts to water quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        While identifying the activities influencing water quality in the
        watershed, the investigators begin developing a list of people most
        likely to be affected by watershed management decisions. These people
        include area residents, municipal officials, industry representatives,
        environmental organizations, agency representatives, and others. We
        sometimes refer to this group as the stakeholders, because they have a
        stake or interest in the watershed. Ideally, these people participate
        in all phases of the watershed management effort.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Alternatives for Addressing Concerns</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once researchers have characterized the watershed and identified water
        quality concerns, they begin developing alternatives to address these
        problems, both individually and collectively. Chapter 4 includes
        descriptions of many of the alternatives available for addressing water
        quality concerns. For example, we can control the effects of municipal
        and industrial point source discharges by constructing good municipal
        and industrial wastewater treatment plants and operating them properly.
        We can minimize the effects of urban stormwater runoff by constructing
        stormwater treatment facilities as part of our drainage systems, and by
        implementing proper erosion control practices during construction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Environmental professionals also have developed alternatives for
        addressing impacts from agriculture and forestry and other nonpoint
        sources of pollution. These alternatives generally consist of using
        best management practices (BMPs) to minimize water pollution from these
        sources. For instance, BMPs for agriculture may include minimizing the
        application of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers; using less
        harmful forms of these products; and using appropriate methods for crop
        rotation, harvesting, and tilling. BMPs for forestry may include
        minimizing road construction, leaving uncut buffer areas around stream
        corridors, and using selective logging instead of clear-cutting.
        Agencies like the United States Department of Agriculture are
        continuing to develop best management practices for minimizing harm to
        water quality from regulated activities such as agriculture and
        forestry.

        Community planners may develop programs for reducing, reusing, and
        recycling materials to help improve water quality in the watershed.
        They may implement other nonstructural methods of control as well. For
        example, they may enact erosion control ordinances, special land use
        regulations, or flood plain protection ordinances if they do not
        already exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before specific alternatives for protecting and restoring the watershed
        are selected and implemented, interested parties usually identify their
        goals. Water quality goals are easier to evaluate if they are specific,
        measurable, and well defined. For example, specific goals could be to:
        1) reduce average summertime temperatures in the lowest one-mile reach
        of the watershed’s main stream by two degrees, in ten years; 2) reduce
        turbidity by twenty percent during spring runoff in five specific
        tributaries, over the next five years; or 3) increase the number of
        resident cutthroat trout by ten percent in ten years throughout the
        entire watershed. A goal should state where, when, how much, and why.
        By defining goals clearly and making them measurable, investigators
        leave less room for interpretation or argument about what it means to
        achieve the goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Broad goals that cannot be defined so rigidly, such as increasing or
        maintaining the health and beauty of the watershed, are also important.
        However, one typically can rely on only general observations to see if
        these goals are being attained, and general observations may vary from
        one person to the next.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once investigators identify watershed protection and restoration goals,
        and a range of alternatives for meeting these goals, they select and
        then begin implementing the best alternatives. To be successful, the
        alternatives should have the support of the people interested in the
        watershed: citizens, municipal officials, industry representatives,
        environmental organizations, agency representatives, and others. If
        these people participate in both analyzing the problems and creating
        the solutions, they are more likely to help fund, monitor, and
        otherwise support the restoration alternatives selected.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Monitoring the Watershed</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once alternatives for improving water quality are implemented,
        researchers begin evaluating how well their efforts are working. They
        monitor water quality in the watershed by collecting and analyzing
        water quality samples.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img
            width="408"

    </p>
    <p>
        Before beginning, investigators outline their monitoring procedures in
        a watershed monitoring plan. Obviously, a carefully prepared plan will
        provide better results than random sampling. The procedures outlined in
        the plan typically include the purpose of the sampling; the time,
        location, and dates of the sampling; equipment needed; number of
        samples to be taken; and parameters to be analyzed. The monitoring plan
        includes a section on quality assurance and quality control that
        outlines acceptable methods for collecting, handling, storing, and
        analyzing samples. The plan also normally requires investigators to
        take duplicate samples and distilled water “blanks” to verify the
        quality of both the sampling and the analyses.
    </p>
    <p>
        A monitoring plan reflects watershed protection and restoration goals
        because it is designed to evaluate success or failure in reaching them.
        For example, the study group may include biomonitoring as part of their
        plan. If one of the goals is to increase the population of fish in the
        watershed’s streams, investigators must count fish to see if this goal
        is being met. Researchers are beginning to use various types of
        biomonitoring to evaluate the health of the aquatic environment.
        Sometimes they use the existence or abundance of specific organisms as
        biological indicators because some species are more or less tolerant to
        pollution than others. They can develop biological indexes of
        integrity, or health, based on these results.
    </p>
    <p>
        When investigators find their goals are not being met, they should
        question themselves about each step in the process. Have they
        identified the watershed’s characteristics correctly? Have they
        identified all activities that significantly affect water quality?
        Which alternatives for protecting and restoring water quality are
        working and which are not? The watershed approach is an iterative
        process. Investigators must continually work through the process to get
        the desired results. Moreover, positive change takes time. Results are
        rarely seen in a month or a year. Rather, it may take decades or longer
        to see measurable improvements.

        <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This purpose of this chapter was to introduce you to the broad approach
        of controlling water pollution by looking at whole watersheds. You
        learned how investigators evaluate watershed characteristics and
        concerns and develop alternatives to address pollution. You also
        learned ways of monitoring the watershed to review improvement efforts.
        As you will see in the next chapter, one of the most important reasons
        for focusing on water quality in our watersheds is to protect our
        drinking water.

            Where do we get our drinking water? Most of us get it from our

            Many of us take this convenience for granted. We do not often stop
            to consider what happens to the water before it reaches our taps or
            the local market.

        The water we use for drinking is no different than any of the other
        waters already described in this book. It is connected to all water on
        earth through the hydrologic cycle, making it subject to contamination
        in a number of ways. No independent pool of “drinking water” exists on
        the planet. Our drinking water comes from either groundwater or surface
        water sources in our watersheds. We normally must spend a great deal of
        time, effort, and money to make sure our drinking water is free from
        contamination and pleasing to our senses of sight, smell, and taste.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Drinking Water Sources</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        A community’s drinking water supply comes from ground and surface water
        sources. Some communities use surface water as their primary source of
        drinking water and groundwater as a backup source. Others use either
        surface or groundwater exclusively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Groundwater sources of drinking water come from water-bearing soil
        formations in our watersheds called aquifers. We store and retrieve
        water from an aquifer in much the same way we would from a bucket of
        sand. If you poured water into a bucket of sand it would trickle to the
        bottom of the sand, but not go through the bottom of the bucket. It
        would be stored in the lower portion of the sand. You could retrieve
        the water by placing a stiff perforated tube into the sand and
        providing suction on the top of the tube, similar to using a straw to
        drink soda from an ice-filled cup. Likewise, when precipitation falls
        on a soil formation resting on bedrock, water percolates through the
        soil and is stored in the lower reaches of the soil, above the bedrock.
        We retrieve water from an aquifer by digging or drilling a well,
        placing a perforated pipe into it, and then using a pump to retrieve
        the water from the bottom of the well.
    </p>
    <p>
        We often obtain high quality drinking water from groundwater sources
        because these sources are protected from surface contamination by the
        soil mantle above them. Groundwater sources may have high
        concentrations of minerals, however, because they are constantly in
        contact with rocks and soil, and some of the minerals in the rocks and
        soil dissolve into the water. Because drinking water from groundwater
        sources is generally of

        high quality, water providers may need only to disinfect the water
        prior to delivery and use by the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        Creeks, rivers, and lakes are also commonly used for drinking water. In
        rare cases, the ocean is used after salt is removed with desalination
        equipment. Drinking water is usually easier to collect from surface
        water sources than from groundwater sources. One might collect drinking
        water from a flowing river by simply placing a screened diversion pipe
        facing upstream into the river. Water flowing down the river would pass
        through the screen, enter the pipe, and continue flowing down the pipe
        to a collection pond or basin. Some communities collect drinking water
        from a lake by placing a screened intake pipe into the lake and then
        pumping the water from the lake to a collection basin.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Drinking Water Treatment</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        State and federal regulations require communities to treat and
        disinfect drinking water before distributing it to the public, because
        surface water sources are more vulnerable to contamination from
        activities occurring at the earth’s surface. Water providers commonly
        use four simple processes to treat and disinfect drinking water before
        delivering it to the tap of the consumer.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, they remove most of the large solids in the water, such as
        leaves, twigs, and sometimes fish, by passing the water through a
        coarse screen at the beginning of the treatment process. This screen is
        similar to a window screen or a fine mesh fence, but sturdier. The
        screen captures materials larger than the openings in the screen, which
        are normally about a quarter of an inch, or 6 mm, wide.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, they use a process called clarification to remove the finer
        particles of sand, silt, and organic debris that pass through the
        coarse screen. They place the water into a large, still basin called a
        clarifier and the fine particles settle from the solution due to
        gravity. Sometimes they mix chemical substances such as
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img
            width="386"
            height="450"
            src="file:///C:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image102.gif"
        />
    </p>
    <p>
        coagulants and polymers with the water before it enters the clarifier
        to improve settling characteristics. These chemicals cause the
        individual fine particles to come together to form larger solids that
        settle more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third, they pass the water through a filter—the most common type is
        made of sand—to remove the remaining fine particles that do not settle
        in the clarifier. They place the water on top of a large basin full of
        sand and allow it to percolate through the sand to the bottom of the
        basin. These basins are often rectangular. They may be ten feet wide by
        twenty feet long, or more, depending on the amount of water being
        treated. Water moves easily through the sand, but most of the solids
        are captured. The treatment plant operators periodically wash the sand
        filter to remove the collected solids by back-washing, which is a
        process where clean water is forced backwards through the sand.
        Sometimes, instead of backwashing, they scrape off and dispose of the
        top layer of the sand, revealing fresh sand below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, once the water has been screened, clarified, and filtered, the
        plant operators disinfect it to kill disease-causing, or pathogenic,
        organisms. Communities commonly disinfect drinking water by adding
        chlorine and mixing it thoroughly with the water— a process called
        chlorination. They may also disinfect the water by adding ozone, a
        process called ozone oxidation, or by passing the water through
        ultraviolet light, which is called UV irradiation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some communities provide additional treatment to remove specific
        dissolved substances not removed through the standard treatment
        processes. The most common substances of concern are calcium,
        magnesium, and dissolved organics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water providers may choose to remove calcium and magnesium because
        these minerals create hard water. Hard water leaves scaly deposits on
        plumbing fixtures and in industrial boilers. Hard water also makes it
        more difficult to clean clothes because soap does not work as
        effectively in hard water as it does in soft water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water softening is the process of removing calcium and magnesium. In
        the simplest type of softening, homeowners remove calcium and magnesium
        by passing water through a container of salt. As water passes through
        the container, the sodium in the salt trades places with the calcium
        and magnesium in the water, thereby removing these hard minerals and
        making the water softer. This chemical process is called ion exchange
        because sodium, calcium, and magnesium, which are all electrically
        charged substances called ions, exchange with each other when water
        comes in contact with the salt.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because dissolved organic substances can cause color, odor, and taste
        problems, some communities also remove them. Removal is accomplished by
        passing the water through an activated carbon filter, which works like
        a sand filter except that water passes through a bed of activated
        carbon instead of a bed of sand. Activated carbon is similar to coal.
        It is a black, carbon material sold in granular or powdered form.
        Carbon is activated by heating it to a high temperature, which causes
        the material to fracture. Dissolved organics are sorbed by the many
        fractured surfaces as water passes through the filter.

        <strong>Drinking Water Concerns</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of us continue to be concerned about the quality of our drinking
        water, even with our ability to treat it to remove many contaminants.
Water quality professionals call these concerns        <em>source-related </em>if the source of our drinking water is
        threatened with contamination, <em>treatment-related</em> if the
concern stems from the processes used to treat the water, or        <em>distribution-related</em> if the distribution system carrying our
        water is in question.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Watershed Disturbances</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Activities that disturb the land in our watersheds threaten the quality
        of our drinking water supply and are source-related concerns. Logging,
        road building, mining and other activities that involve digging into
        the soil or removing vegetation can be particularly harmful if they are
        not done carefully. Stormwater running over these disturbed areas can
        pick up sand, silt, clay, and other contaminants and carry them into
        our drinking water supply. Recall that both our surface water and
        groundwater supplies are fed by precipitation falling into our
        watersheds.

        Because of the threat of contamination, some communities have adopted
        rules or ordinances prohibiting land-disturbing activities in
        watersheds that supply their drinking water. Other communities allow
        some restricted activities in their watersheds, provided that these
        activities are done in a controlled and limited way. These communities
        customarily require proponents of any landdisturbing activity to
        implement proper erosion control techniques and spill prevention and
        control measures to prevent eroded soils or accidental spills from
        contaminating the water supply. Chapter 4 includes descriptions of
        specific measures used to control erosion and spills.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why not just remove pollutants from our drinking water supply with
        proper treatment if watershed disturbances cause contamination? This
        approach would be shortsighted because treatment is expensive and not
        always effective. The cost of removing pollutants from our water supply
        is much higher than the cost of keeping them out in the first place.

        <em>Groundwater Contamination</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Groundwater pollution can be associated with a variety of substances,
        such as industrial chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides, or animal and
        human wastes. These materials can percolate into the soil and
        contaminate the groundwater below if not managed properly. Once in the
        groundwater, they may be difficult or impossible to remove.
    </p>
    <p>
        The threat of groundwater contamination is currently a concern in
        several cities across the United States. For example, Portland,
        Oregon’s main water supply comes from surface water in the protected
        Bull Run Watershed located on the slopes of nearby Mount Hood. However,
        the backup water supply that provides supplemental water during drought
        conditions comes from groundwater wells lower in the valley. Recently,
        investigators discovered that groundwater near these wells was
        contaminated with the organic solvent trichloroethylene (TCE). An
        expensive cleanup effort is now underway to remove the contamination
        and protect the groundwater supply. Fortunately, these groundwater
        wells are not Portland’s primary source of drinking water.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other parts of the United States, groundwater is contaminated with
        inorganic substances, such as nitrates, that are found in sewage,
        animal wastes, nitrogen fertilizers, and food processing wastes.
        Nitrate contamination is a problem in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,
        Nebraska, and South Dakota. The Environmental Protection Agency
        estimates that, in these states, one out of every four private wells
        has excessive levels of nitrate.
    </p>
    <p>
        High concentrations of nitrate cause two primary health concerns.
        First, as discussed in Chapter 2, infants given water or formula
        containing high concentrations of nitrate may develop a disease called
        methemoglobinemia, which can be fatal. Second, high concentrations of
        nitrate pose a potential cancer risk to the general population. The
        body converts ingested nitrates into carcinogenic compounds called
        nitrosamines. Researchers have found that nitrosamines cause cancer in
        laboratory animals. They are still investigating the relationship
        between high concentrations of nitrate and cancer in humans.

        <em>Microbial Contamination</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The contamination of drinking water by microorganisms is a serious
        health concern worldwide. In fact, only about twenty-five percent of
        the world’s population has safe drinking water. Doctors attribute many
        illnesses and deaths in developing nations to improper sanitation and
        contamination of the water by the microorganisms found in human feces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bacteria, viruses, and protozoans are all microorganisms capable of
        contaminating our drinking water and causing disease. For instance,
        bacteria are responsible for typhoid, paratyphoid, salmonellosis,
        shegellosis, bacillary dysentery, and Asiatic cholera. Viruses are
        responsible for infectious hepatitis and poliomyelitis. Protozoans are
        responsible for amebic dysentery and Giardiasis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium <em>Salmonella typhi</em>.
        Although typhoid fever is no longer a common disease in the United
        States, it was one of the major causes of death decades ago, and it
        continues to be a threat in developing nations. Typhoid fever causes a
        high fever, diarrhea, and ulceration of the small intestine. It is
        highly contagious. The expression “typhoid Mary” came as a result of
        the transmission of typhoid bacteria by a cook who moved across the
        United States. She was a carrier of typhoid, and transmitted the
        disease to her customers by contaminating their food and water.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hepatitis A virus causes infectious hepatitis. Symptoms of this
        disease include fever, weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps,
        and enlargement of the liver. The hepatitis virus can be present in
        drinking water contaminated with feces. Thousands of cases of
        infectious hepatitis are reported every year in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
        Public health professionals are currently investigating
Cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal disease caused by the parasite        <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>. They are also studying Giardiasis, the
        disease caused by the Giardia protozoan <em>Giardia lamblia</em>.
        Although this disease is not generally life threatening, it does result
        in very uncomfortable, flu-like symptoms and diarrhea that may last for
        ten days or more. The Giardia protozoans form cysts that are resistant
        to disinfection. The relatively large size of Giardia, however, makes
        them easy to remove with proper filtration. Giardiasis is a common
        malady for hikers and campers who drink untreated and unfiltered water.
        Wild animals like beaver and deer carry Giardia in their feces, and
        water that comes into contact with their waste becomes contaminated.
    </p>
    <p>
        We cannot test our drinking water for the presence of every known
        disease-causing organism. It would be impractical; testing would take
        too long and it would be too expensive. Instead, we test for the
        presence of these organisms by the use of indicator species. The most
        common indicator species are the fecal coliform group of bacteria. This
        group includes organisms like the bacterium <em>Escherichia coli</em>,
        which is always present in feces. Since coliform bacteria occur in
        large numbers in waters contaminated with feces, their presence in a
        water sample indicates that the sample may be contaminated with feces.
        Their presence does not prove that the water is contaminated but it
        does give cause for concern, especially if they occur in large numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clearly, we must protect our drinking water from microbial
        contamination to prevent the outbreak of disease. We can provide
        protection by keeping our water free from contamination and by
        disinfecting it to kill the harmful organisms prior to delivery.
    </p>

        <em>Chlorinated Organics</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The methods we use to treat our drinking water sometimes cause the
        formation of potentially harmful substances and become
        treatment-related concerns. For example, to kill microorganisms, we
        commonly disinfect our drinking water with chlorine using the
        chlorination process described in Chapter 4.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, chlorination can sometimes cause the formation of
        harmful chlorinated organic substances called trihalomethanes (THMs).
        Trihalomethanes are generated when chlorine combines with organic
        molecules found in many water supplies. These organic molecules come
        from the breakdown of vegetation and other organic materials found in
        the water. THMs cause cancer in laboratory animals, an indication that
        they may cause cancer in

        Because of the problems with chlorine, communities are considering
        other methods of disinfection, such as passing the water under
        ultraviolet light or mixing the water with ozone.

        <em>Copper and Lead</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Copper and lead pose a serious distribution-related problem. Water
        moving through distribution pipes and home plumbing on the way to the
        consumer may dissolve and pick up copper and lead along the way. The
        sources of copper and lead are the pipes, which until recently were
        manufactured using copper and lead; pipe linings; joints; and the
        solder used to hold the pipes together.
    </p>
    <p>
        Long-term exposure to lead, even in low concentrations, can cause
        improper brain functioning and development. Scientific studies have
        clearly established the link between lead intake and the intellectual
        impairment of children. Unlike some contaminants, lead does not flush
        out of the body with body fluids. Once ingested, it remains in the fat
        and body tissue for life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Copper is generally less of a concern than lead, but some studies
        indicate that prolonged ingestion of high concentrations of copper may
        result in liver damage. We do not yet clearly understand the effects of
        prolonged ingestion of low concentrations of copper, however.
        Regardless of its toxic effects, copper is often undesirable because it
        can impart a bad taste to drinking water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of the concerns about copper and lead in drinking water, the
        United States Environmental Protection Agency has prepared information
        to help the public better understand and evaluate potential problems.
        Some of this information is available through their web site at the
        address listed in Chapter 8.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can do three simple things at home to reduce your potential
        exposure to lead in your drinking water. First, let your water run for
        a minute or two in the morning when you first use it, or if it hasn’t
        been used for several hours. Stagnant water left standing in your pipes
        has a greater chance to dissolve and pick up any lead the may exist in
        your home plumbing. By flushing out this stagnant water, you replace it
        with fresh water containing less lead. Second, use water from your cold
        water tap for drinking and cooking. Hot water is more corrosive; it can
        dissolve lead in your home plumbing more easily than cold water,
        causing a higher concentration of lead in your drinking water. Third,
        never use materials containing lead for making home plumbing repairs.
        Do not use lead solder, pipes, or connections.

        The Safe Drinking Water Act sets the goal for microbial contaminants at
        zero, since there are no known thresholds for these contaminants. Under
        certain circumstances, a single virus ingested with drinking water
        might cause disease. For practicality, however, the act requires water
        providers to remove approximately 99.9 percent of most microbial
        contaminants.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SDWA also establishes Secondary Drinking Water Standards to protect
        drinking water from contaminants that primarily affect the aesthetic
        qualities of water, such as color, taste, and odor. Some of the
        Secondary Drinking Water Standards are listed below.

        The Primary and Secondary standards listed above provide a summary of
        the MCLs for some of the most important contaminants. However, other
        standards and special conditions also apply. EPA’s web site for
        drinking water (www.epa.gov/ safewater/mcl/html) provides a more
        detailed listing and explanation of these standards.

        If you are concerned about the quality of your drinking water, you can
        have it tested. Some communities provide this service free. You also
        can hire a private laboratory to test your water. Businesses offering
        this service appear in the telephone directory under laboratories or
        water testing services. Three simple and relatively inexpensive tests
        that will provide you with useful information are the tests for
        bacteria, nitrate, and lead. After getting your results, compare them
        with the drinking water standards.

    <p>
        This chapter introduced you to ground and surface water sources of
        drinking water and to some of the activities that threaten their
        quality. It also introduced you to methods of treating water to make it
        suitable for drinking. As you continue to learn about clean water, you
        may choose to get more personally involved in protecting it. The final
        chapter of this book tells you how.

        The previous chapters of this book introduced many of the scientific
        and legal aspects of water pollution control. This chapter offers some
        ideas about how to begin applying what you have learned.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Water Quality at Home</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The easiest and most personal place to get involved in water quality
        protection is at home, since many of your everyday decisions affect the
        quality of the water in your community. This section describes ten
        simple ways you can contribute to cleaner water.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Use Environmentally Friendly Cleaning Products</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Biodegradable and nontoxic household cleaning products are better for
        water quality than poisonous cleaning products. They are also better
        for your family’s health. Many environmentally friendly cleaners are
        now on the market. Read labels when buying cleaners and look for those
        that are biodegradable and nontoxic. Beware of products with skull and
        cross bones or similar warnings that tell you the contents are
        poisonous. Poisonous cleaners are a hazard to both human health and the
        environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use any toxic cleaning products you may have appropriately and
        completely so you do not need to dispose of them. If you have leftover
        cleaners, dispose of them properly. Do not flush them down the toilet
        or throw them in the trash.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flushing toxic cleaning products down the toilet is inappropriate
        because municipal treatment plants are designed to treat sewage, not
        toxic waste. Toxic cleaners can cause upsets at a treatment plant,
        reducing its ability to provide proper treatment. Some toxic products
        may pass through the plant without being treated at all. These
        pass-through pollutants end up being discharged to the river, where
        they cause water pollution, or contaminating the sewage solids. If your
        community applies its sewage solids to the land as fertilizer, these
        pass-through pollutants can adversely affect the soil and groundwater.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than putting toxic products out with your regular trash, check
        with your disposal company to find out what provisions have been made
        for collecting household hazardous wastes. You

        can usually take these wastes, such as toxic cleaning chemicals and
        paints, to special collection sites. Community employees then take
        responsibility for properly managing and disposing of these waste
        products. Some can be recycled, while others must be disposed at
        government-regulated waste disposal sites.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Use Household Water Wisely</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can help maintain water quality in your community by using water
        wisely at home. Your use of water for drinking, washing dishes and
        clothes, taking showers, flushing toilets, and caring for your lawn and
        garden all have an effect on water quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Water providers invest a great deal of time, effort, and money to make
        sure we have a safe supply of water for drinking and other household
        uses. They filter and disinfect the water before delivering it to
        individual households through pipes and pumps. They hire professionals
        to design, construct, and operate the treatment facilities to ensure
        the water is safe. They construct laboratories and run analytical tests
        on the water supply to ensure that contaminants are not present. Our
        communities spend millions of dollars to provide us with a safe supply
        of drinking water.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you waste drinking water, you are indirectly threatening water
        quality. When residents of a community use more water than necessary or
        planned, the community must either spend more money or provide poorer
        quality water. For instance, assume a community has the staff and
        treatment facilities to provide its citizens with one million gallons
        of safe water for drinking and other household uses each day. If the
        demand became two million gallons per day because everyone used twice
        the amount they really needed, the community would either have to spend
        more money for additional treatment or provide lower quality water to
        its citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
        For most of us, all the water we use for washing our dishes and
        clothes, taking showers, and flushing our toilets goes from our house
        to the local sewage treatment plant. If treatment plants are
        overloaded, they do not operate efficiently, and the treated water that
        flows back into the river is of poorer quality. If we send more
        wastewater to the treatment plant, operators are forced to use more
        chlorine to disinfect the larger volume of water, which results in
        additional discharges of harmful chlorine into the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The water you use in lawn and garden maintenance may pick up pollutants
        such as fertilizers, pesticides, and soil particles. Runoff from
        excessive irrigation can wash these pollutants off your property, into
        the stormwater system, and ultimately into our rivers and streams.
    </p>
    <p align="right">
        A finite amount of clean water is available in the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        By taking clean water out of our rivers and streams to supply our water
        needs at home, we reduce the amount of clean water available for other
        uses and other species. Moreover, the water we return to the ecosystem
        is almost always lower in quality than when we received it. This
        process of taking water of high quality and replacing it with water of
        poorer quality results in an overall reduction in the quality of water
        in the environment. The more wisely and efficiently we use our water at
        home, the cleaner our water will be for everyone and everything.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Use Household Energy Wisely</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hydropower and fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas continue to supply
        most of our energy needs. All of these sources of energy have
        associated water quality concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Researchers have linked the declines in water quality and habitat on
        major rivers, such as the Columbia River in the northwestern United
        States, to dams used for hydropower. These reductions in water quality
        and habitat are threatening some populations of fish. Using energy more
        efficiently at home will require fewer dams to provide hydropower to
        meet our energy needs. Minimizing our need for energy will allow us to
        operate essential dams in ways that maximize resource protection, not
        just energy production.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p align="right">

    </p>
    <p>
        Building fewer dams, and managing existing ones better, will result in
        less water being diverted from our rivers, less evaporation, less
        habitat loss, lower water temperatures, and an overall improvement in
        water quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using energy efficiently at home also will result in a reduced need for
        fossil fuels. Less need for fossil fuels will result in fewer oil
        spills, less offshore mining of oil and natural gas, fewer coal mines,
        fewer hydrocarbon emissions into the atmosphere, and an overall
        improvement in water quality.

        <em>Compost Your Lawn Clippings, Yard Debris,</em>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>and Food Wastes</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the biggest environmental challenges facing society today is the
        proper management of the huge amounts of solid waste we generate. Some
        large cities have so much solid waste they have literally created
        mountains of it. A ski hill near Detroit, Michigan, for instance, is
        referred to as Mount Trashmore because it was built on a mountain of
        trash.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most communities dispose of the solid waste we leave at the curbside in
        landfills. These landfills are expensive to design, construct, and
        maintain. By reducing your generation of solid waste, you can help
        reduce the need for new landfills and save space in the existing ones.
        By generating less waste, we can operate our existing landfills in a
        more environmentally safe manner and use our valuable land resources
        for purposes other than waste disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even landfills that are carefully designed and operated pose some
        threat to ground and surface water quality. Water mixing with refuse in
        a landfill can pick up pollutants and create leachate (see Chapter 4).
        Moreover, if the landfill liner leaks, leachate can move down through
        the soil and contaminate groundwater. Communities that collect and
        treat their landfill leachate must ultimately discharge it into a
        stream or back onto the land, where it may run off and eventually reach
        surface water.
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned earlier, the use of water by humans generally results in a
        reduction in its quality. For example, the rainwater that falls on a
        landfill is usually of very high quality. In uncovered landfills, this
        high quality rainwater filters down through materials in the landfill,
        picking up pollutants and creating landfill leachate. Even if this
        leachate is properly collected, treated, and disposed of, the resulting
        water will be poorer in quality than the original rainwater.
    </p>
    <p>
        Composting your biodegradable household wastes is one way you can
        contribute to the goal of reducing the amount of solid waste that goes
        into our landfills. You do not need to dispose of your lawn clippings,
        leaves, and other yard debris or food wastes in the trash. These
        materials are all biodegradable and you can turn them into compost.
        Compost piles are easy to create and they require little maintenance.
        You can usually keep your household compost pile relatively small
        because materials in the compost are constantly becoming smaller
        through biodegradation. Since compost contains many nutrients, you can
        use it as a natural fertilizer for your landscaping needs. Your local
        library probably has several books on backyard composting available.
        Some of the web sites listed at the end of this chapter also have
        information about composting.

        <em>Recycle and Reuse Household Goods instead of Throwing</em>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Them in the Trash</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Another way you can reduce solid waste is to recycle materials like
        newspaper, glass, tin cans, aluminum, magazines, office paper, waste
        paper, and some plastic products. The list of recyclable household
        materials continues to grow as we discover better recycling processes
        and more uses for recycled products. Many communities now sponsor
        recycling programs for their residents. Some of these programs require
        you to take your recyclable materials to a central location and others
        pick up the materials at your curbside.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to reducing the amount of waste that we put into our
        landfills, recycling helps to conserve energy and natural resources.
        For example, aluminum manufacturing and paper production plants are
        extremely energy intensive and consume
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <img
            width="369"

        />
    </p>
    <p align="right">
        Curbside recycling, Portland, Oregon
    </p>
    <p>
        natural resources. Aluminum manufacturing plants are usually built near
        large rivers and run by hydropower. Using recycled aluminum reduces the
        need for hydropower and also reduces the environmental impact
        associated with removing raw aluminum from the earth. Similarly,
        recycling paper reduces the need to log timber from our watersheds,
        requires the use of fewer pulping and bleaching chemicals, and results
        in an overall benefit to water quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reusing household goods also reduces the use of energy and natural
        resources and limits the amount of waste material placed in our
        landfills. You can help protect the environment by using items that can
        be washed and used again instead of used once and thrown away. You can
        use cloth napkins instead of paper towels and cloth diapers instead of
        disposable ones. You can find other uses for containers instead of
        throwing them away. For example, you can reuse peanut butter jars for
        storing bulk food items or milk jugs for storing emergency water
        supplies.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Follow Good Car Maintenance Practices.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        A well-maintained car results in less water pollution. You do not have
        to go far on a rainy day before seeing the characteristic sheen of gas
        or oil spots on the roadway. Often, poorly maintained cars with leaking
        gas tanks or oil pans are responsible for these spots. These spilled
        petroleum products will wash off the surface of the road, into a nearby
        ditch or drainage pipe, and ultimately into a nearby waterway.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you maintain your own car by changing the oil, antifreeze, or
        windshield wiper fluid, make sure you collect and dispose of the used
        fluids properly. Do not allow them to get into the water and cause
        pollution. If these liquids are poured down a storm drain, flushed down
        the toilet, or poured onto the soil, they can cause surface water or
        groundwater pollution. Many gas stations and quick-lube oil stations
        will accept your used automobile fluids because they can recycle them.
        The recycling businesses sometimes pay these stations for their used
        products.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Use Your Automobile Less and Use It More Selectively</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because using an automobile results in air pollution and water
        pollution, the more you use it, the more you contribute to the
        deterioration of water quality. Recall that air and water are linked by
        the hydrologic cycle, as described in Chapter 1. Contaminants in the
        air are picked up by water vapor in the atmosphere. These contaminants
        fall to the earth with precipitation and are transferred to the land
        and water. The phenomenon of acid rain provides an extreme example of
        the link between air pollution and water pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
        The more we use our automobiles, the more need we have for gas and oil
        production and a host of related activities that have the potential to
        harm water quality, such as offshore oil exploration, mining, and
        transportation of oil and gas over our waterways. Instead of driving
        your car, use mass transportation. You can take the bus or the commuter
        train to work and support your community’s mass transportation efforts.
        The bus and commuter train can provide the same transportation service
        as hundreds of

        cars. Or, you can join a carpool. One carload of commuters can take the
        place of four or more separate vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also use your automobile more selectively. Walk or ride your
        bike instead of hopping in your car to run a nearby errand. Reduce the
        amount of time you are on the road by completing several errands on one
        trip instead of making a separate trip for each. Consider doing your
        errands with friends and neighbors. Use phone or mail order to reduce
        your trips to the store or shopping mall. By making thoughtful
        transportation choices and using your automobile less and more
        selectively, you can contribute to protecting water quality and the
        environment, and also save money.

        for your home landscaping needs. These products can help you have tall
        trees, lush lawns, and beautiful flowers. Unfortunately, they can also
        cause water pollution if they are overapplied or otherwise used
        improperly. When it rains, these products can be carried by stormwater
        runoff from your property into the nearby storm drainage system and the
        nearest stream. These products can also leach down through the soil and
        cause groundwater pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use these products at all, use them carefully. Always follow the
        manufacturer’s recommendations. Never over-apply pesticides,
        herbicides, or fertilizers. With these products, more is <em>not</em>
        better. Over-application results in wasted product that is then
        available to harm water quality, and possibly children and pets. To
        avoid having these products get into the storm drainage system, do not
        apply them in wet weather and do not apply them near storm drains or in
        other areas where they could easily run off your property.
    </p>
    <p>
        Better yet, avoid or limit your use of these products by opting for
        more natural methods of landscaping and pest control. Instead of using
        pesticides, you can use birds, marigolds, ladybugs, nematodes, and mild
        soap to control pests. Instead of using herbicides, you can remove
        weeds by hand or use black landscaping fabric to cover areas and
        prevent weeds from growing in the first place. Instead of using
        packaged fertilizers, use homemade compost made from lawn clippings,
        food waste, and other biodegradable materials.

        <em>Educate and Involve Your Children, and Set a Good Example</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Environmental education is more popular now than ever. Many of our
        children are learning about the environment through activities at
        school, scouts, and 4-H clubs. Our children are generally more
        interested and aware of the environment than we were at their age. We
        can reinforce their interest and awareness at home by reading to them
        about the environment. Read portions of this book to them. Get other
        books and videos about nature that are appropriate for their age.
    </p>
    <p>
        Set an example for your children by applying the simple techniques
        described in this chapter: use water and energy efficiently, recycle,
        use pesticides and herbicides sparingly if at all, and use compost for
        fertilizer. By setting a good example for your children, you help
        educate them, reinforce what they learn at school, and contribute to
        protecting water quality and the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may want to involve your children in environmental protection at
        home as a way of making their education real. You can give them
        responsibility for helping to sort recyclables, let them help you with
        your household composting, and ask them to help conserve water. By
        allowing your children to get involved, you show them that you are
        interested in their environmental education.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <em>Be Mindful of Runoff from Your Property</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Precipitation falling on your property soaks into the soil, is taken up
        by your plants, or runs off into the storm drainage system or nearby
        ditch. To limit the pollutants in the stormwater running off of your
        property, you can take measures to reduce the pollutants on it. As
        discussed earlier, you can use fewer pesticides, herbicides, and
        fertilizers, and care for your automobiles properly so they do not leak
        oil and gasoline. You can also help reduce stormwater pollution by
        reducing the runoff leaving your property. For example, you can reduce
        the use of impervious materials like concrete by using gravel and
        sand-set bricks for walkways and patios. This practice allows rainwater
        to soak into the underlying soil. You can reduce runoff from rooftops
        by directing it into infiltration pipes placed in the yard, or by
        collecting the water in barrels and using it later for watering your
        lawn, plants, or garden.
    </p>
    <p>
        These ten relatively simple ways of protecting water quality at home
        are only a beginning. You can probably think of many more, specific to
        your own home, if you stop to give it some thought. The most important
        thing to remember is that clean water begins at home. What <em>you</em>
        do at home makes a difference.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Public Involvement</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also work for clean water by getting involved in water quality
        protection in your community. A recent television commercial uses a
        clever approach for selling perfume. In the commercial, an actress
        speaks in a low voice, saying, “If you want

        to capture someone’s attention, whisper.” We strain to hear what she is
        saying. By speaking in a whisper, she draws our attention. An
        individual person’s voice can be likened to a whisper. Sometimes it
        catches one’s attention better than the roar of the crowd. An
        individual voice is personal. Rather than being the voice of an
        unidentifiable mass, it is the voice of a single, caring human being.
    </p>
    <p>
        By speaking out individually, you tell the world, “I care enough about
        the quality of our waters to stand up and be counted; I am willing to
        take the responsibility to work towards protecting and restoring the
        water environment, which is so important to us all.”
    </p>
    <p>
        You can make a difference by writing letters to your local, state, and
        federal representatives to tell them about the specific water quality
        concerns that affect your community. They have the responsibility of
        answering your questions, keeping you informed, and listening to what
        you have to say. It is their job to listen so they can represent you
        properly. They also have staff to help them fulfill their
        responsibilities when they cannot carry out the tasks personally.

        You can use this book for reference to add specific details that show
        you are informed. You may want to state your specific concerns and make
        reference to appropriate rules and regulations or the chemistry and
        microbiology involved. You can also describe your broader concerns
        about water quality and water pollution control.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your local post office often posts the names and addresses of your
        local representatives. Some states print a “Blue Book” which includes
        listings of local, state, and federal representatives and how they can
        be contacted. You can also get this information at your local library
        or online.

        local addresses and phone numbers are also included in the governmental

        Your voice will also be heard by voting according to your convictions.
        Inform yourself about water quality issues and find out where your
        elected officials stand. Listen and watch radio and television
        broadcasts where these issues are debated. A single phone call to your
        representative or their staff may be all it takes to find out how they
        represented you on a particular issue and why. You can use the power of
        your individual vote to show your support for good representation.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can attend public meetings to voice your concerns or submit written
        comments during public review and comment periods. Many of the programs
        designed to protect water quality provide opportunities for this type
        of public involvement. For example, prior to issuing an NPDES permit,
        state agencies provide the opportunity for public comment on the draft
        permit. State agencies also review and revise water quality standards
        every three years. Once agency staff develops draft standards, they
        make these drafts available to the public for review and comment. Other
        programs like NEPA provide the opportunity for public review and
        comment on environmental assessments and environmental impact
        statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often, the agency responsible for a particular environmental program
        issues notices to inform the public about specific actions being
        considered by the agency. For instance, public notices are prepared by
        most states before they issue NPDES permits. You can often get on an
        agency’s mailing list to receive these types of notices by simply
        contacting the agency. Call and inform the receptionist of your
        interest and your call should be directed appropriately.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <strong>Environmental Organizations</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes it takes more than one voice to get the clean water message
        heard. It often takes the voices of organized groups. Nearly all
        environmental organizations have an interest in protecting water
        quality, though it may not be their primary focus. You may want to
        consider joining one or more of these groups as another way of getting
        involved. Groups and organizations can help you stay informed about
        water quality and other environmental issues and they can be effective
        in representing members in the political and legal arenas.
    </p>
    <p>
        Environmental groups play an important role in a democratic society.
        They represent the goals and beliefs of the founders of the group and
        its members. You should realize, however, that each of these groups has
        a different personality and agenda. Some groups lean to the
        conservative side and some are more liberal. Some are more willing to
        affect change by taking drastic measures. The key to finding a group
        that suits you is to find one with a personality like yours—a group
        with which you share common beliefs.

        One way of finding out about a particular group is to review a copy of
        the group’s mission statement or statement of goals. What does the
        group believe in? Another way is to review a copy of the group’s annual
        financial statement. What happens to the money members donate?

        <em>Your Resource Guide to Environmental Organizations</em>
        by J. Seredich is a good resource for learning more about environmental
        groups (see <strong>Additional Reading</strong> below). This guide
        includes contact information, purpose, accomplishments, and membership
        benefits for many environmental organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The listing of Internet resources below also includes contact
        information for environmental organizations. The author does not
        specifically endorse any of these groups, and this list is not
        complete. It is simply a place to get started. Many of these groups
        have local offices where you can get additional information.

        <strong>Internet Resources</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Internet provides a wealth of information about water quality,
        water pollution control, and related topics. You can access the
        Internet through your home computer, using a variety of Internet
        service providers. Or, you may be able to access the Internet on
        computers at your local school or library. A teacher or librarian can
        probably assist you in accessing the Internet if you are not familiar
        with the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should also be able to search for web sites based on your topic of
        interest. For example, you should be able to insert a topic such as
        “wetland treatment” into your computer’s search engine and your
        computer will list web sites that are related to this topic.

        : A plan required by Section 311 of the Clean Water Act for sites where
        petroleum products could contaminate waters if spilled. These documents
        include procedures to prevent spills from occurring and to respond
        effectively if they do.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Stormwater residuals</strong>
        : Solids and other pollutants that are left in stormwater treatment
        facilities following treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Stormwater runoff</strong>
        : Water that runs off of the surface of the land and other surfaces
        after a rainstorm or snowstorm.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Stratification</strong>
        : The process whereby separate layers of water develop in a water body,
        each with different physical and chemical characteristics. For
        instance, thermal stratification may occur in a deep lake if the water
        at the top and bottom develop distinctly different temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Superfund</strong>
        : The common term applied to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
        Compensation and Liability Act.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Surface water</strong>
        : All water that is on the surface of the earth, including streams,
        rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This term is frequently used to
        differentiate water on the surface from groundwater, which resides
        below the surface of the earth.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Tertiary treatment</strong>
        : A form of advanced wastewater treatment that goes beyond conventional
        primary and secondary treatment to further treat and “polish” effluent
        for special uses. May involve the use of special filters or chemical
        processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Thermal pollution</strong>
        : Any form of pollution that causes an increase in the temperature of
        the water.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Total dissolved solids (TDS)</strong>
        : A measure of the solids in a water sample that are so small they are
        essentially dissolved and can pass through a fine paper filter,
        expressed in units of concentration such as milligrams per liter.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Total maximum daily load (TMDL)</strong>
        : The quantity of material allowed to be discharged into a waterway
        from all recognized sources while still maintaining applicable water
        quality standards. TMDLs are calculated when a water body does not meet
        water quality standards to determine the maximum allowable load prior
        to implementing pollution control alternatives. The TMDL is the sum of
        the individual waste load allocations from point sources and load
        allocations from nonpoint sources and background, plus the amount set
        aside for reserve.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Total solids (TS)</strong>
        : A measure of all the solids in a water sample, including those that
        are suspended and dissolved, expressed in units of concentration such
        as milligrams per liter.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Total suspended solids (TSS)</strong>
        : A measure of the solids in a water sample that are too large to pass
        through a fine paper filter, expressed in units of concentration such
        as milligrams per liter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Toxic</strong>
        : Harmful to living organisms. Poisonous.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Trybutilin (TBT)</strong>
        : An additive used in marine paints to prevent barnacles from growing
        on the hulls of boats. TBT causes chronic toxicity. Aquatic organisms
        exposed to it, such as shellfish, become deformed.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Trihalomethanes (THMs)</strong>
        : Potentially cancer-causing substances that form when chlorine is
        added to water containing organic materials.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Viruses</strong>
        : Tiny microorganisms—approximately ten to one hundred times smaller
        than bacteria—that cannot be seen without a special type of microscope.
        Viruses are parasites; they cannot live outside the cell of another
        organism, which is called the host. Viruses are responsible for human
        diseases such as smallpox, infectious hepatitis, influenza, and
        poliomyelitis.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Waste load allocation</strong>
        : The maximum load of a pollutant each point source discharger is
        allowed to release into a particular waterway. Waste load allocations
        are used to limit point source discharges into water quality limited
        waterways so that water quality standards can be achieved.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Water Quality Certification</strong>
        : The process of obtaining approval from state environmental agencies
        to conduct activities that may affect water quality and are subject to
        federal permits. Water Quality Certification is required by Section 401
        of the Clean Water Act for activities such as building dams (which
        requires a federal permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory
        Commission) and filling or removing material from wetlands (which
        requires a federal permit from the Army Corps of Engineers).
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Water quality limited</strong>
        : Water bodies that do not meet water quality standards for parameters
        such as temperature, pH, or dissolved oxygen.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Water quality standards</strong>
        : The values or statements used to define the acceptable
        characteristics of water bodies, mandated by Section 303 of the Clean
        Water Act. Water quality standards for characteristics such as pH,
        dissolved oxygen, and temperature are developed by individual states
        and submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency for approval.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Water softening</strong>
        : The process of removing calcium, magnesium, and other divalent
        cations, elements containing two positive charges. In the simplest type
        of water softening, calcium and magnesium are removed by passing water
        through a container of salt. The calcium and magnesium trade places
        with the sodium in the salt through a process called ion exchange,
        removing them from the water.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Watershed</strong>
        : A portion of land that all drains into the same water body; also
        called a drainage basin. Precipitation falling into a watershed flows
        downhill from the mountaintops and ridges, which are the boundaries of
        the watershed, to the streams and lowlands below. Watersheds are made
        up of all the land forms, vegetation, organisms, and waters in the
        basin.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Wetland</strong>
        : An area that is saturated with water at a sufficient frequency to
        support the growth of vegetation adapted for life in saturated soil
        conditions. Many different type of wetlands exist and they go by many
        different names such as bogs, swamps, marshes, and wet meadows.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <strong>Zone of initial dilution (ZID)</strong>
        : That area within a permitted mixing zone where standards for acute
        toxicity may be waived.
