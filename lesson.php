<h2>Course Resources</h2>

<p>Welcome to Plant. In addition to the course modules, we&#39;ve included some additional course materials.</p>



<p>You can also find them by clicking on the Course Resources tab on the left side of the <a href="learn/covid-19-contact-tracing/home/welcome" target="_blank">course overview page</a>.</p>

<h2>Technical Support</h2>

<p>Please visit <a href="" target="_blank"></a> for answers about the  platform. If you aren&#39;t able to find the answer you need among the documents available in the Learner Help Center, you can chat with  support by clicking the chat icon in the bottom right corner of the Learner Help Center home page.</p>

<p><strong>Please do not e-mail or call Johns Hopkins University or the course instructor with technical questions about the  platform, your account, or your certificate of completion. Neither Johns Hopkins University nor the course instructor has access to your account details or records of your performance in the course. Instead, please visit </strong><a href="https://learner.coursera.help/" target="_blank"></a><strong> for technical support.</strong></p>
