    <h2>
        Preface
    </h2>

        <img
            width="580"

    <p>
        Water quality is a growing concern throughout the developing world.
        Drinking water sources are under increasing threat from contamination,
        with far-reaching consequences for the health of children and for the
        economic and social development of communities and nations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deteriorating water quality threatens the global gains made in
        improving access to drinking water. From 1990 to 2004 more than 1.2
        billion people gained access to improved water sources, but not all of
        these new sources are necessarily safe. Unsafe handling and storage of
        water compounds the problem. Water drawn from protected sources may be
        contaminated by the time it is ultimately consumed in households.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deteriorating water quality also threatens the MDG water target of
halving the proportion of people without sustainable access to        <strong>safe</strong> water. While the world is currently on track to
        meet the target in terms of numbers of sources constructed, it may not
        be on track if the quality of water in new sources is fully taken into
        account.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chemical contamination of water supplies – both naturally occurring
        and from pollution – is a very serious problem. Arsenic and fluoride
        alone threaten the health of hundreds of millions of people. But more
        serious still is the microbiological contamination of drinking water
        supplies, especially from human faeces. Faecal contamination of
        drinking water is a major contributor to diarrhoeal disease, which
        kills millions of children every year. As populations, pollution and
        environmental degradation increase, so will the chemical and
        microbiological contamination of water supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
        An increasing body of evidence shows that water quality interventions
        have a greater impact on diarrhoea mortality and morbidity than
        previously thought, especially when interventions are applied at the
        household level and combined with improved water handling and storage.
        Water quality is thus becoming a major component of sectoral
        programmes.
    </p>
    <p>
        UNICEF is a major stakeholder in the water, sanitation and hygiene
        (WASH) sector and has a responsibility to work with its partners to
        improve the quality of water through its programmes around the world.
        This responsibility was highlighted in the 2006 UNICEF WASH Strategy
        Paper that emphasized the need both to protect water resources and to
        contribute to global efforts to mitigate water quality problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        This handbook is a comprehensive a new tool to help UNICEF and its
        partners meet this responsibility. It is primarily aimed at UNICEF WASH
        field professionals, but it will also be useful to other UNICEF staff
        and for partners in government, other external support agencies, NGOs
        and civil society. The handbook provides an introduction to all aspects
        of water quality, with a particular focus on the areas most relevant to
        professionals working in developing countries. It covers the effects of
        poor water quality, quality monitoring, the protection of water
        supplies, methods for improving water quality, and building awareness
        and capacity related to water quality. Finally, the handbook provides
        an extensive set of links to key water quality references and
        resources.

        UNICEF would like to acknowledge with thanks the contributions of Greg
        Keast and Rick Johnston, the joint authors of this publication.
    </p>
    <p>
        They were guided by Vanessa Tobin and Mansoor Ali from UNICEF Programme
        Division and received valuable inputs from Lizette Burgers, Mark
        Henderson and Rolf Luyendijk from UNICEF, and from Jane Springer, who
        edited the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        The publication could not have been written without the participation
        of UNICEF WES field officers and consultants, who provided important
        technical inputs as well as advice on the type and scope of information
        required by staff and partners working in the field. In particular,
        UNICEF would like to thank staff members Belinda Abraham, Chander
    </p>

        KaiKai, Femi Odediran, Waldemar Pickardt, Jan Willem Rosenboom, Zhenbo
        Yang, and Jose Zuleta.
    </p>
    <p>
        UNICEF would also like to thank the peer reviewers who graciously took
        the time to provide critical inputs that greatly improved the quality
        of the document: Jan Willem Rosenboom from the World Bank Water and
        Sanitation Program, Dr. Jamie Bartram and Federico Properzi from the
        WHO Water, Sanitation and Health Programme, Dr. T.V. Luong from UNICEF
        and Dr. Peter Wurzel.
    </p>
    <p>

<h2>
    1.1 The importance of water quality
</h2>
<p>
    Safe water is a precondition for health and development and a basic human
    right, yet it is still denied to hundreds of millions of people throughout
    the developing world. Waterrelated diseases caused by insufficient safe
    water supplies coupled with poor sanitation and hygiene cause 3.4 million
    deaths a year, mostly among children. Despite continuing efforts by
    governments, civil society and the international community, over a billion
    people still do not have access to improved water sources.
</p>
<p>
    The scale of the problem of water quality is even larger. It is
    increasingly clear that many of the existing improved sources in developing
    countries do not provide water of adequate quality for domestic purposes. A
    well-known example of this is the extensive contamination of tubewells with
    naturally occurring arsenic in Asia. As serious as this and other cases of
    chemical contamination are, the principal cause of concern is
    microbiological contamination, especially from faeces. While groundwater is
    generally of much higher microbiological quality than surface water, an
    increasing number of sources and systems used by people for drinking and
    cooking water are not adequately protected from faecal contamination. This
    is due to a variety of factors, including population pressure, urbanization
    and the inadequate construction, operation and maintenance of water
    systems.
</p>
<p>
    Even fully protected sources and well-managed systems do not guarantee that
    safe water is delivered to households. The majority of the world’s people
    do not have reliable household water connections and many of these must
    still physically carry water and store it in their homes. Studies show that
    even water collected from safe sources is likely to become faecally
    contaminated during transportation and storage. Safe sources are important,
    but it is only with improved hygiene, better water storage and handling,
    improved sanitation and in some cases, household water treatment, that the
    quality of water consumed by people can be assured.
</p>
<p>
    An increasing body of evidence is showing that water quality interventions
    have a greater impact on diarrhoea incidence than previously thought,
    especially when interventions are applied at the household level (or
    point-of-use) and combined with improved water handling and storage
    (Fewtrell et al, 2005; Clasen et al, 2007).
</p>
<p>
    In recognition of the growing importance of ensuring safe water in
    programming for children, the 2006 global UNICEF strategy paper (UNICEF
    water, sanitation and hygiene strategies for 2006-2015) stresses the
    importance of water quality in its sectoral programmes. The strategy paper
    outlines specific water quality strategies in the areas of strengthening
    national monitoring systems, community-based surveillance and the
    protection of freshwater resources. The strategy paper also highlights the
    need for UNICEF country programmes to promote improved water safety at the
    household level including the development of point-of-use water treatment
    systems.
</p>
<p>
    The task of governments, UNICEF and all other stakeholders in the area of
    water quality, is to create conditions to ensure that water remains safe
    throughout the supply cycle: from catchment basins, through water systems
    and into the home.
</p>
<h2>
    1.2 Purpose, scope and use of this handbook
</h2>
<p>
    This handbook is designed as a resource for field staff members from UNICEF
    and its partners involved in the water, environment and sanitation (WES)
    sector. Water quality is an increasingly important component of WES
    programmes, and new skills are required to effectively plan, implement and
    management water quality activities. Relatively few sector professionals
    have a detailed knowledge of the water quality sub-sector and this handbook
    aims to address this.
</p>
<p>
    This handbook does not attempt to cover all aspects of water quality
    programming. The subject area is very broad, encompassing everything from
    the promotion of improved water resources management to the design of
    household water filters. What it does provide is an introduction to all
    aspects of water quality, with a particular focus on the areas most
    relevant to professional staff members working in developing countries. The
    handbook focuses on real-world problems faced by poor people, and on
    community- and household-based, low-cost solutions.
</p>
<p>
    The handbook provides extensive pointers to key texts and resource
    materials for reference when users require more detailed information.
    Preference is given to texts and resources freely available on the
    Internet. Two key references that should be used by WES professionals along
    with this handbook are the UNICEF WES programme guidelines series on water
    and sanitation (including manuals on water, sanitation, communication and
    hygiene promotion) and the WHO guidelines for drinking-water quality.
</p>
<p>
    The handbook is made up of six chapters, including this introduction.
</p>
<p>
    Chapter 2 focuses on the effects of poor water quality, covering
    microbiological contamination and the main chemical contaminants that pose
    a threat to human health. It also provides information on WHO water quality
    guideline values and the processes for national standards development.
</p>
<p>
    Chapter 3, on water quality monitoring and surveillance, discusses both the
    techniques for measuring water quality and the management of national
    monitoring and surveillance programmes, including community surveillance.
</p>
<p>
    Protecting water supplies from contamination is generally more effective
    than treating contaminated water. Chapter 4 describes contamination sources
    and pathways and techniques for water system protection. It includes
    sections on hygiene, sanitation and the safe handling and household storage
    of water.
</p>
<p>
    Chapter 5 outlines the principal technologies for water treatment, both for
    microbiological contamination and the main chemical contaminants. Included
    in the chapter is specific information on water quality treatment at the
    municipal, community and household levels, and on treating water in
    emergencies.
</p>
<p>
    The handbook concludes with Chapter 6, a discussion on advocacy for
    increased national resource allocation for water quality, communication
    with communities on the importance of water quality, and capacity building
    at national and community levels.

    The Effects of Poor Water Quality
</h1>
<p>

    />
</p>
<p>
    In spite of concerted efforts to improve access to safe drinking water
    (notably the International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade, from 1981
    to 1990), an estimated 1.1 billion people lack access to an improved water
    source. Over three million people, mostly children, die annually from
    water-related diseases. Almost two million of these deaths are the result
    of diarrhoeal diseases, which are caused by the ingestion of water
    contaminated by faecal matter, as well as by inadequate sanitation and
    hygiene. Contaminated water resources can also contribute to the spread of
    diseases caused by skin contact or by vectors.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to causing direct health impacts, unsafe drinking water has a
    number of subtle or indirect adverse health effects:
</p>
<p>
    • Children weakened by frequent diarrhoea episodes are more likely to be
    seriously affected by malnutrition and opportunistic infections (such as
    pneumonia), and they can be left physically stunted for the rest of their
    lives.
</p>
<p>
    • Chronic consumption of unsafe drinking water can lead to permanent
    cognitive damage (see box).
</p>
<p>
    • People with compromised immune systems (e.g., people living with HIV and
    AIDS) are less able to resist or recover from water-borne diseases.
Pathogens which might cause minor symptoms in healthy people (e.g.,    <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, rotaviruses, Heterotrophic
    Plate Count microorganisms) can be fatal for the immunocompromised.
</p>
<p>
    The consequences of poor water quality go beyond health. Chronic bouts of
    water-related diseases impose significant social and economic burdens both
    on victims themselves and society as a whole. Poverty alleviation and the
    other Millennium Development Goals will be difficult to achieve without
    improvements in water quality.
</p>
<h5>
    Safe water and cognitive impairment
</h5>
<p>
    Lack of safe drinking water contributes to intestinal helminth infections,
    which cause malnutrition and anaemia in children (Stephenson et al., 2000).
    Chronic diarrhoeal disease can also exacerbate malnutrition. Both early
    childhood malnutrition and anaemia can cause permanent effects in brain
    development: malnourished and anaemic children grow up to be less
    intelligent and do less well in school (Pollitt, 1995).
</p>
<p>
    Recent research indicates that diarrhoeal disease may also directly impact
    cognitive development (Dillingham and Guerrant, 2004). Brazilian children
    aged six to ten who had suffered serious and ongoing episodes of diarrhoea
    during the first two years of life performed less well than other children
    on standard intelligence tests, even after controlling for socio-economic
    status and early childhood malnutrition or helminth infections (Niehaus et
    al., 2002). Similarly, Berkman et al. (2002) showed that Peruvian children
    who experienced multiple infections with <em>Giardia </em>scored lower on
    intelligence tests.
</p>
<p>
    Chronic exposure to chemicals in drinking water may also affect cognitive
    development. It is well known that ingestion of lead leads to significant
    behavioural change and cognitive impairment in children. Other chemicals
    can also have effects: for example, children exposed to high levels of
    arsenic during early childhood score significantly lower on
    neurobehavioural tests than children not exposed to arsenic (e.g. Tsai et
    al., 2003; Wasserman et al., 2004). High levels of manganese in water can
    also have neurological effects (Wasserman et al, 2006).
</p>
<p>
    Cognitive impairment can last a lifetime and contributes to a vicious cycle
    of malnutrition and poverty.
</p>
<p>
    While microbiological contamination is the largest public health threat,
    chemical contamination can be a major health concern in some cases. Water
    can be chemically contaminated through natural causes (arsenic, fluoride)
    or through human activity (nitrate, heavy metals, pesticides). The physical
    quality of water (e.g., colour, taste) must also be considered. Water of
    poor physical quality does not directly cause disease, but it may be
    aesthetically unacceptable to consumers, and may force them to use less
    safe sources. Finally, drinking water can be contaminated with
    radioactivity, either from natural sources or human-made nuclear materials.
</p>
<h2>
    2.1 Regulatory limits for water quality
</h2>
<p>
    Because of the negative public health impacts of unsafe water, national
    government agencies have established drinking-water quality standards that
    public sources must meet or exceed. In most cases, private water supplies
    are not subject to national drinking-water standards. A distinction is
    often made between standards based on health impacts and those based
    primarily on the acceptability of drinking water, with health-based
    standards more strictly enforced.
</p>
<p>
    When setting national drinking-water standards, most countries consider the
standards set in other countries and the    <em>Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality</em> (GDWQ) (WHO, 2006). The most
    recent versions of GDWQ is the third edition (available as a hardcopy)
    published in 2004 and the same edition incorporating the first addendum
    published in 2006 and available electronically on the WHO water quality web
    pages: (<u>www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/guidelines/en</u> )
</p>
<p>
    The GDWQ provides guidance in setting health-based targets for three
    classes of contaminants: microbiological, chemical and radiological. For
    some contaminants, WHO recommends guideline values (GVs) for safe levels in
    drinking water. A guideline value represents the concentration of a
    constituent that does not exceed tolerable risk to the health of the
    consumer over a lifetime of consumption. A fourth category is the aesthetic
    quality of drinking water, but WHO makes no specific recommendations for
    these parameters, since they do not directly impact health and
    acceptability is dependent on local conditions. Instead, the GDWQ refers to
    typical levels that may lead to complaints from consumers.
</p>
<p>
    WHO guideline values should not be interpreted as mandatory universal
    drinking-water standards. Rather, they should be used to develop risk
    management strategies in the context of local or national environmental,
    social, economic and cultural conditions. This approach should lead to
    standards that are realistic and enforceable in a given setting, to ensure
    the greatest overall benefit to public health. This may lead to national
    targets that differ appreciably from the guideline values. It would be
    inappropriate, for example, to set such stringent drinking-water standards
    that regulatory agencies lack the funding or infrastructure to enforce
    them. This would result either in too many water sources being closed and
    insufficient access to water, or widespread flouting of the regulation. An
    important concept in the allocation of resources to improving
    drinking-water safety is that of incremental improvements towards long-term
    quality targets. Priorities set to remedy the most urgent problems (e.g.,
    protection from pathogens) may be linked to long-term targets of further
    water quality improvements (e.g., improvements in the acceptability of
    drinking-water). See Chapter 6 for further discussion of advocacy for
    national drinkingwater standards.

    <em>
        The judgment of safety – or what is a tolerable risk in particular
        circumstances – is a matter in which society as a whole has a role to
        play. The final judgment as to whether the benefit resulting from the
        adoption of any of the health-based targets justifies the cost is for
        each country to decide

                    South African regulations define three guidelines for
                    chemical quality of drinking water: Class 0 represents
                    ideal drinking water. Class I is a level considered to be
                    acceptable for lifetime consumption, and Class II is the
                    maximum level allowable for short-term consumption. Most
                    Class 0 standards are very similar to WHO guideline values,
                    but some are more stringent.

As for microbiological quality, WHO guidelines values are only given for    <em>E. coli </em>or faecal bacteria, and indicate that these should not be
    detected in any 100 mL sample. South African microbiological standards,
    like chemical standards, have three levels of strictness. At least 95% of
    samples should have no detected faecal coliforms, somatic coliphages,
    enteric viruses or protozoan parasites. However, up to 4% of samples could
    have up to 1 count per 100 mL of these pathogens, and up to 1% of samples
    could contain up to 10 counts per 100 mL. A similar rule exists for total
    coliforms, except that 10 and 100 counts per 100 mL are permissible at the
    4% and 1% levels. In spite of this, the goal of disinfection should be to
    attain 100% compliance with no detected incidence of contamination. Source:

<h2>
    2.2 Microbiological contamination
</h2>
<p>
    Pathogens are micro-organisms that can cause disease in humans. They fall
    into three major classes:
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Bacteria </strong>are single-celled organisms, typically 1 to 5
    µm in size (1000 µm = 1mm).
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Viruses </strong>are protein-coated genetic material that lack
    many cell structures, and are much smaller than bacteria – in most cases 10
    to 300 nm (1000 nm = 1µm).
</p>
<p>
    • <strong>Parasites</strong> are single-celled organisms that invade the
    intestinal lining of their hosts. The two main types of parasites are
    protozoa and helminths (intestinal worms). Parasites have a complex life
    cycle, and most at some stage form large protective cysts or eggs (4-100
    µm), which can survive outside of the host bodies.
</p>
<p>
    Diseases are usually classified by pathogen class in medical texts.
    However, for public health purposes it is more useful to follow the Bradley
    classification (White et al., 1972), based on transmission routes in the
    environment (Table 2.2). The advantage of this classification system is
    that it is easy to see what interventions are likely to reduce the
    incidence of different water-related diseases.

    WHO recognizes that these targets would be difficult to achieve in some
    cases, especially in rural communities with untreated water supplies, and
    recommends that in these settings, the guidelines values should be seen as
    goals for the future, rather than an immediate requirement. More realistic
    health-based targets for microbiological quality should be set, using
    quantitative risk assessment and taking into account local conditions and
    hazards. These health-based targets form the basis for Water Safety Plans,
    and may include specific water quality targets, performance targets for
    water treatment, directly specified water treatment practices, or a
    measurable reduction in disease incidence.

<h3>
    2.2.1 Water-borne diseases
</h3>
<p>
    <em>
        Definition: water-borne diseases are diseases caused by the ingestion
        of water contaminated by human or animal faeces or urine containing
        pathogens. <strong> </strong>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Many bacteria, viruses, protozoa and parasites can cause disease when
    ingested. The majority of these pathogens derive from human or animal
    faeces, and are transmitted through the faecal-oral route. Although both
    animal and human faeces are threats to human health, human faeces are
    generally the most dangerous. Faecal pathogens can be classified as causing
    both water-borne and water-washed diseases, so they are discussed in this
    section. Section 2.2.2 focuses on those pathogens that are likely to be
    exclusively water-washed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Table 2.4 lists some of the main pathogens of concern in drinking water.
    Most of these pathogens can be found in faecal matter from infected humans
    and many may also be present in animal faeces.

<h5>
    The dose makes the infection
</h5>
<p>
    Pathogen infectious doses (ID<sub>50</sub>, or the dose required to cause
infection in 50% of healthy adults) may vary widely, from around 10<sup>3</sup> for <em>Shigella </em>to 10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> for<em>V. Cholera</em>. ID<sub>50</sub>s are typically lower (&lt; 10    <sup>2</sup>)<sup> </sup>for viruses and parasites, and may be as low as
    one for some viruses. The doses needed to affect children, especially when
    malnourished or suffering from chronic diarrhoea, may be significantly
    lower. The severity of diarrhoeal episodes is also related to infectious
    dose: for many pathogens a low ingested dose can result in mild,
    self-limiting diarrhoea while a high ingested dose is more likely to cause
    severe, lifethreatening illness (Esrey et al., 1985). Also, populations
    build up a certain level of tolerance to local pathogens – visitors from
    other areas may be much more susceptible to water-borne illnesses than
    locals.
</p>
<p>
    Proper treatment of drinking water, including disinfection, should produce
    pathogen-free water. However, the great majority of people in developing
    countries, especially in rural areas, rely on untreated (though possibly
    improved and protected) water sources. These water sources almost certainly
    contain measurable levels of coliforms, most of which are harmless, and may
    well contain low to moderate levels of faecal coliforms. While the goal
    should always be to ensure access to a pathogen-free drinking-water source,
    it would be a mistake to strictly enforce a zero-pathogen standard for
    untreated water sources. For example, the closure of a lightly contaminated
    source could force users to collect drinking water from grossly
    contaminated sources such as irrigation canals (Cairncross and Feachem,
    1993).
</p>
<h5>
    Impact of diarrhoeal disease
</h5>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Approximately 4 billion cases of diarrhoea each year cause at least 1.8
    million deaths, 90% are children under the age of five, mostly in
    developing countries. This is equivalent to one child dying every 15
    seconds, or 20 jumbo jets crashing every day. These deaths represent
    approximately 4% of all deaths, and 18% of under-five child deaths in
    developing countries. Only acute respiratory infections (ARI) have a higher
    impact, causing 19% of under-five deaths.
</p>
<p>
    88% of these deaths are attributable to unsafe water supply, inadequate
    sanitation, and poor hygiene. Water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions
    reduce diarrhoeal disease on average by between one-quarter and one-half.
</p>
<p>
    Source: WHO/UNICEF (2000), WHO (2005a)
</p>
<p>
    The number of diarrhoeal deaths has decreased significantly over the past
    50 years. A review of epidemiologic studies (Kosek et al., 2003) found an
    estimated 4.2 million deaths per year (mostly in children under 5) from
    diarrhoeal disease from 1955-1979, dropping to 3.3 million per year from
    1980-1989, and 2.5 million per year from 19922000. The improvement was most
    evident for children under 1: diarrhoeal mortality rates dropped from 23.3
    deaths per thousand children to 8.2 over the same period (see Figure 2.1a).

<p>
    However, the rate of reported diarrhoeal cases (morbidity) has not shown a
    similar improvement (see Figure 2.1b). Children under 5 had a median of 3.2
    episodes of diarrhoea per year between 1992 and 2000, little changed from
    previous reviews. Since population continues to grow, especially in poorer
    areas where diarrhoea is more prevalent, the number of cases of diarrhoeal
    disease is actually increasing (Guerrant et al., 2002).
</p>
<p>
    The improvement in mortality but not morbidity can partially be explained
    by improved case management of diarrhoeal disease: use of oral rehydration
    therapy (ORT) in diarrhoeal disease treatment is estimated to have
    increased from 15% to 40% between 1984 and 1993. A second explanation is
    that water, sanitation and hygiene interventions have decreased the number
    of pathogens being ingested, which would be expected to result in
    improvements in mortality but not morbidity (Esrey et al., 1985; Esrey,
    1996). Finally, improvements in nutrition over the past two decades might
    also have contributed to shorter and less severe bouts of diarrhoea.
</p>
<p>
    Most water-borne pathogens infect the gastrointestinal tract and cause
    diarrhoeal disease. In most cases, the specific pathogen responsible for
    infection is not identified, and case identification and treatment is
    fairly generic. Two very serious forms of diarrhoeal disease, cholera and
    shigellosis, should be considered separately because of their severity and
    tendency to create epidemics.

    <em>Indeterminate diarrhoeal disease </em>
</p>
<p>
    The most common causes of severe diarrhoeal disease (see also “Pathogens
    that cause diarrhoeal disease in children under 5”) are:
</p>
<p>
    • <u>Rotaviruses</u>. Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhoea
    among children, resulting in the death of over 600,000 children annually
    worldwide. By age 5, nearly every child will have an episode of rotavirus
    gastroenteritis, 1 in 5 will visit a clinic, 1 in 65 will be hospitalized,
    and approximately 1 in 293 will die (Parashar et al., 2003).
</p>
<p>
    • <u>Pathogenic E. coli</u>. Most strains of E. coli are harmless, but some
    can cause serious diarrhoea. Pathogenic, or diarrhoeagenic, E. coli is
    primarily ingested through food, but can also contaminate drinking-water
    supplies. Pathogenic E. coli are further broken down into several groups
    based on the way in which they cause disease. Enterotoxigenic E. coli
    (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are the main causes of childhood
    diarrhoea. Other groups include enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC),
    enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). ETEC
    is the most frequently isolated pathogen in studies of children with
    diarrhoeal disease, accounting for some 210 million diarrhoeal episodes and
    380,000 deaths annually. Taken together, pathogenic strains of E. coli
    represent one of the most common causes of infant diarrhoea worldwide
    (Nataro and Kaper, 1998).
</p>
<p>
    • <u>Campylobacter jejuni</u>. Approximately 5%-14% of all diarrhoea
    worldwide is thought to be caused by ingestion of C. jejuni in contaminated
    food or water. Infection may cause bloody diarrhoea, fever, nausea and
    vomiting, though many of those infected show no symptoms.
    Campylobacteriosis is rarely fatal, except among very young, very old, or
    immunocompromised people.
</p>
<p>
    • <u>Protozoan parasites</u>. Entamoeba hystolica, the cause of amoebic
    dysentery, is prevalent worldwide – it is estimated that more than 10% of
    the world’s population is infected with E. histolytica, but on average,
    only 1 in 10 infected people show symptoms, which include stomach pain,
    bloody stools and fever. Giardia intestinalis (also known as G. lamblia)
    and Cryptosporidium parvum are also globally prevalent parasites. Both have
    animal as well as human hosts, can persist in surface water, are resistant
    to chlorination, and have very low infectious doses (as low as one cyst).
    Some stool surveys of patients with gastroenteritis have found 20%
    contained Cryptosporidium, and 3-20% contained Giardia. One survey of
    children in a Brazilian shantytown found Cryptosporidium infection in 90%
    of children under one year old. Up to 20% of AIDS deaths in industrialized
    countries are attributed to cryptosporidiosis (WHO, 2002b).
</p>
<p>
    • <u>Calciviruses</u>. Tests have only recently been developed to identify
    this family of viruses, which includes the Norwalk-like viruses. However,
    calciviruses have
</p>
<p>
    been identified as the most common cause of diarrhoeal outbreaks in the
    United States. Some evidence suggests that these viruses may also play an
    important role in diarrhoeal diseases among children in developing
    countries.

                    A number of epidemiologic studies have attempted to
                    identify the pathogen responsible for diarrhoea in infected
                    children. Three recent studies conducted in Bogota,
                    Colombia;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Montevideo, Uruguay illustrate that
                    pathogenic <em>E</em>. <em>coli </em>especially ETEC and
                    EPEC) and rotavirus are the two most frequently found
                    pathogens. Other pathogens tend to be more variable with
                    location. The Bogota and Dhaka studies also examined
                    non-diarrhoeal control populations, and found a significant
                    number were infected with one or more diarrhoeal pathogens.
                    This illustrates that only a fraction of people infected
                    with diarrhoeal pathogens develop symptoms.

<h6>
    Epidemic diarrhoeal disease
</h6>
<p>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    Two diarrhoeal pathogens, <em>Shigella </em>and <em>Vibrio cholera</em>,
    are particularly infectious and can cause severe epidemics.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Shigella dysenteriae </em>
    type 1<em> </em>is the pathogen responsible for bacillary dysentery, or
    bloody diarrhoea. <em>Shigella </em>has a very low infectious dose and has
    caused epidemics in Central America, south and southeast Asia, and
    sub-Saharan Africa since the late 1960s. There are an estimated 165 million
    cases of <em>Shigella </em>infection each year, resulting in some 1.1
million deaths, mostly of children under 5 (Kotloff et al., 1999).    <em>Shigella </em>causes diarrhoea with blood and/or pus, high fever,
    abdominal or rectal pain, but not vomiting. Treatment is problematic: oral
    rehydration therapy is not as effective for dysentery as for watery
    diarrhoea, and <em>Shigella </em>is increasingly resistant to antimicrobial
    drugs. Severe shigellosis is common among immunocompromised patients.
</p>
<p>
    Epidemics of cholera have devastated Europe and North America since the
    early 1800s. Cholera originated in the Ganges delta, where it remains
    endemic, apparently surviving in rivers and estuaries associated with
    blue-green algae. Occurrence is often seasonal, with peaks in spring and
    fall associated with algal blooms. The current global epidemic, or pandemic
    (the seventh) is caused by the classical El Tor O1 biotype, though since
    1992 a new biotype, designated O139 or Bengal, has caused epidemics in
    South Asia. This strain has since been identified in several other Asian
    countries, but has not yet extended to other continents. Cholera continues
    to be a very serious health threat. In 2006, over 230,000 cases of cholera
    were reported, including over 6,300 deaths, but WHO estimates that this
    represents only 5-10% of the actual number of cases.
</p>
<p>
    Cholera results in severe water (“rice-water like”) diarrhoea and vomiting,
    but no fever. More than 90% of cases are mild, and most cases respond well
    to treatment with oral rehydration therapy. However, if untreated, severe
    dehydration and death can occur within days.
</p>
<p>
    Epidemic diarrhoea (both shigellosis and cholera) can be triggered by
    natural disasters or political upheavals that disrupt the normal water
    supply. For example, following the Rwanda crisis in 1994 over 500,000
    refugees fled into camps in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo. During
    the first month after the influx, epidemics of cholera and
    antimicrobial-resistant shigellosis caused at least 48,000 cases and 23,800
    deaths.
</p>
<h6>
    Non-diarrhoeal water-borne diseases
</h6>
<p>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    While most water-borne pathogens cause diarrhoeal disease, a few important
    water-borne diseases affect other parts of the body.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Typhoid fever </strong>
    (not to be confused with typhus fever, caused by body lice) is caused by
    ingestion of <em>Salmonella typhi </em>bacteria in food or water, and
    affects about 17 million people each year, causing some 600,000 deaths.
    Infection causes a sudden high fever, nausea, severe headache, and loss of
    appetite. It is sometimes accompanied by constipation or diarrhoea.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hepatitis</strong>
    , or liver inflammation, is caused by viral infection. Symptoms include
    yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, nausea and
    vomiting. Two forms of the disease, hepatitis A and E, are primarily caused
    by ingestion of faecally contaminated drinking water. Hepatitis A causes
    about 1.5 million infections each year (mostly in children), and can occur
    in epidemics. Hepatitis E is less common than hepatitis A, and occurs
    mainly in epidemics caused by monsoon rains, heavy flooding, contamination
    of well water, or massive uptake of untreated sewage into city water
    treatment plants. No specific treatment exists for hepatitis A or E, but
    most (&gt;98%) patients recover completely. Hepatitis can have more serious
    effects on older or immunocompromised people, and pregnant women are
    particularly vulnerable to hepatitis E, with approximately 20% mortality
    rates. Hepatitis B, C and D are not considered water-borne diseases, as
    they are transmitted by contact with body fluids.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Polio </strong>
    is a highly infectious viral disease that mainly affects children under 5.
    Most infected people show no symptoms, but severe cases cause irreversible
    paralysis. As a result of a concerted initiative – the Global Polio
    Eradication Project – reported cases have declined by over 99% since 1988,
    from an estimated more than 350,000 cases to 1,919 reported cases in 2002.
    Still, polio can easily spread among unimmunised populations, and in 2003
    polio was still endemic in Afghanistan, parts of India, and Pakistan in
    Asia; and Egypt, Niger, northern Nigeria and Somalia in Africa. Since
    poliovirus is primarily transmitted through the faecal-oral route, safe
    water and sanitation interventions can help reduce risk, but the top
    priority is to ensure high immunization coverage of infants and children.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Legionellosis </strong>
    may also be considered a water-borne disease, but infection occurs through
    inhalation of water droplets containing <em>Legionella </em>bacteria.
    Severe infection leads to Legionnaire’s disease, characterized by pneumonia
    and 5-15% mortality rates. More mild infections cause Pontiac fever, which
    usually requires no treatment. <em>Legionella </em>prefer warm environments
    (&gt;36°C) and can survive in the environment in association with bacteria
    or protozoan hosts. <em>Legionella </em>can grow in water storage tanks,
    boilers, or pipes in distribution systems. Outbreaks of Legionnaire’s
    disease are fairly rare.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Leptospirosis </strong>
    is a bacterial disease caused by ingestion or bodily contact with water
    contaminated with the urine of infected animals, especially rats. Symptoms
    include a high fever, headache, vomiting, chills and aches. If not treated,
    the disease can cause serious damage to internal organs. The disease is
    difficult to diagnose and is often overlooked, but may be important,
    especially following flooding.
</p>
<h3>
    2.2.2 Water-washed diseases
</h3>
<p>
    <em>
        Definition: water-washed diseases are diseases caused by inadequate use
        of water for domestic and personal hygiene. <strong> </strong>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Control of water-washed diseases depends more on the quantity of water than
    the quality (see box, “Water quality and diarrhoea”, Chapter 5). Most of
    the diarrhoeal diseases should be considered to be water-washed as well as
    water-borne, and are not discussed further here. Four types of water-washed
    diseases are considered here: soil-transmitted helminths; acute respiratory
    infections (ARI); skin and eye diseases; and diseases caused by fleas,
    lice, mites or ticks. For all of these, washing and improved personal
    hygiene play an important role in preventing disease transmission.
</p>
<h6>
    Soil-transmitted helminths
</h6>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Helminths are intestinal worms (nematodes) that are transmitted primarily
    through contact with contaminated soil. The most prevalent helminths are
ascaris (<em>Ascaris lumbricoides</em>), hookworm (    <em>Ancylostoma duodenale </em>and <em>Necator americanus</em>) and
    whipworm (<em>Trichuris trichiura</em>). Together, these ‘geohelminths’
    currently infect about one-quarter to one-third of the world’s population.
    Worms suck blood and deprive their hosts of essential nutrients
    (particularly iron and Vitamin A). Children with heavy worm burdens are
    more likely to have iron deficiency anaemia, malnutrition, and to suffer
    impaired growth and cognitive development. Over 130 million children suffer
    from highintensity geohelminth infections; helminths cause about 12,000
    deaths each year (WHO, 2002a). These diseases can be considered
    water-washed, and improved hygiene and sanitation can reduce disease
    incidence. Mass deworming of children is also recognized as an effective
    control measure.
</p>
<h6>
    Acute Respiratory Infections
</h6>
<p>
    Acute respiratory infections (ARI) including pneumonia are responsible for
    approximately 19% of total child deaths every year. There is an increasing
    body of evidence demonstrating that good hygiene practices, especially
    hand-washing with soap, can significantly reduce the transmission of ARI.
    For example, a 2005 study in Karachi, Pakistan found that children younger
    than five years in households that received soap and hand-washing promotion
    had a 50 percent lower incidence of pneumonia than children in control
    areas. Because of this link between ARI and hygiene, it can now be
    considered a water-washed disease (Luby et al, 2003; Cairncross, 2003;
    Rabie and Curtis, 2006).

    Skin and eye diseases
</h6>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Trachoma </strong>
    is the world’s leading cause of preventable blindness: about 6 million
    people are blind due to trachoma, and more than 10% of the world’s
    population is at risk. Globally, the disease results in an estimated US
    $2.9 billion in lost productivity each year (International Trachoma
Initiative, 2003). Trachoma is caused by the    <em>Chlamydia trachomatis </em>bacteria, which inflame the eye. After years
    of repeated infections, the inside of the eyelids may be scarred so
    severely that the eyelid turns inwards with eyelashes rubbing on the
    eyeball. Flies are implicated in the transmission of trachoma, and are
    often seen feeding on the discharge from infected eyes. The best control
    method for trachoma (and for <strong>conjunctivitis</strong>, a less
    serious eye disease) is improved access to water for facewashing.

    2.2.3 Water-based diseases
</h3>
<p>
    <em>
        Definition: water-based diseases are infections caused by parasitic
        pathogens found in aquatic host organisms.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Schistosomiasis </strong>
    (bilharziasis) is a major parasitic disease in tropical and sub-tropical
    regions, second only to malaria in terms of socio-economic and public
    health importance. An estimated 160 million people in 74 countries are
    infected and about 10% of these suffer severe consequences from the
    disease, including tens of thousands of deaths every year. Infection is
    caused by flatworms, or blood flukes, called schistosomes, which spend part
    of their life cycle inside snail hosts. People become infected through skin
    contact with infected water, mainly during fishing and agricultural
    activities. Integrated water, sanitation and health interventions can
    reduce disease prevalence by up to 77%, mainly through improved hygiene and
    less contact with contaminated surface water (Esrey et al., 1991). However
    some Asian snail varieties (including S. japonicum and perhaps S.
</p>
<p>
    mekongi) have important animal reservoirs, and improved hygiene and
    sanitation are not effective control measures. Therefore control of the
    snail population is an important part of shistosomiasis control programmes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dracunculiasis </strong>
    (guinea-worm disease) is a debilitating disease caused by the roundworm
</p>
<p>
    <em>Dracunculus medinensis</em>
    . Guinea-worm larvae in water bodies are ingested by the
</p>
<p>
    <em>Cyclops </em>
water flea. People become infected by drinking water contaminated with    <em>Cyclops</em>: the larvae are released in the stomach, migrate through
    the intestinal wall, and grow to adult worms, which can reach 600 to 800 mm
    in length. The worms eventually emerge (usually from the feet), creating
    intensely painful sores. When infected people try to relieve the pain by
    soaking their feet in ponds, the female worms expel hundreds of thousands
    of larvae into the water, completing the cycle. Improving drinking-water
    quality, by either switching from surface to groundwater sources or
    filtering surface water to remove <em>Cyclops</em>, can reduce transmission
    by over 75% (Esrey et al., 1991). As a result of intensive eradication
    efforts, guinea-worm disease prevalence has dropped from about 50 million
    in the 1950s to about 50,000 cases in 2002, the majority of which were in
    Sudan.
</p>
<h3>
    2.2.4 Water-related diseases
</h3>
<p>
    <em>
        Definition: water-related diseases are caused by insect vectors which
        either breed in water or bite near water.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    These diseases are not directly related to drinking-water quality. However,
    consideration of vector control during the design, construction and
    operation of surface water reservoirs and canals (for drinking water or
    irrigation purposes) can reduce the potential for waterrelated disease
    transmission. The most common vector insects are mosquitoes and flies.

<h2>
    2.3 Chemical contamination
</h2>
<p>
    Water quality planners have traditionally focused on ensuring that drinking
    water is microbiologically safe for consumption. This emphasis was, and
    still is, justified by the serious health threat posed by microbiological
    contamination of drinking water and the fact that many people have access
    only to water that is clearly unsanitary. However, the chemical quality of
    drinking water cannot be taken for granted. Yet in many water supply
    projects, the only chemical parameters tested are pH, and perhaps iron and
    chloride, because of the aesthetic problems these can cause (see 2.4). It
    is increasingly recognized that chemical contamination of drinking-water
    resources can seriously damage health.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike microbiological contamination, chemical contamination leads to
    health problems primarily through chronic exposure. (Nitrate is one
    exception to this rule, as short-term exposure can cause
    methaemoglobinaemia – see section 2.3.3). Contamination may persist for
    years before detection, and when people have developed chronic health
    problems from unsafe drinking water, it may be too late to restore health
    simply by switching to a safe water source.
</p>
<p>
    There are literally thousands of chemicals that could in theory cause
    health problems in drinking water. WHO lists guideline values (GVs) for
    nearly 200 chemicals, ranging from naturally occurring arsenic and fluoride
    to synthetic chemicals found only in industrial settings. Fortunately only
    a relatively small number are likely to pose real threats in drinking
    water. WHO has developed a useful classification system based on classes of
    contaminant sources, rather than chemical characteristics, which we will
    follow here:
</p>
<p>
    1. Naturally occurring
</p>
<p>
    2. Industrial sources and human dwellings
</p>
<p>
    3. Agricultural activities
</p>
<p>
    4. Water treatment or materials in contact with drinking water
</p>
<p>
    5. Pesticides used in water for public health purposes
</p>
<p>
    6. Cyanobacterial toxins
</p>
<h5>
    Priority chemical contaminants
</h5>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is not possible to test water for all of the chemicals that could cause
    health problems, nor is it necessary: most chemicals occur rarely and many
    result from human contamination of a small area, only affecting a few water
    sources. However, three chemicals have the potential to cause serious
health problems and to occur over widespread areas. These are    <strong>arsenic </strong>and <strong>fluoride</strong>, which can occur
    naturally, and <strong>nitrate</strong>, which is applied to large areas of
    agricultural land as fertilizer. These three contaminants are more often
    found in groundwater, though surface water can also be impacted. When
    planning new water supply projects, especially using groundwater resources,
    these three contaminants should be given priority. A second priority should
    be inorganic compounds that commonly cause water to be rejected for
aesthetic purposes: metals (principally <strong>iron </strong>and    <strong>manganese</strong>), and <strong>salinity</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    These priority contaminants are discussed in detail below in section 2.3.1,
    and in Chapter 5. See also the box on removal of priority inorganics in
    section 5.2.
</p>
<p>
    Table 2.6 summarizes guideline values for inorganic contaminants, along
    with Maximum Allowable Concentrations (MACs) fixed by the European Union
    and Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) set by the US Environmental
    Protection Agency.

    particular concern since the area of contamination can be quite extensive,
    and because contamination can go unnoticed in the absence of a testing

<p>
    Arsenic in drinking water is a global threat to health, potentially
    affecting about 140 million people in at least 70 countries worldwide
    (Ravenscroft, 2008). It is considered by some researchers to have more
    serious health repercussions than any other environmental contaminant
    (Smith, 2007).
</p>
<p>
    Arsenic occurs naturally in soils and rocks, with typical concentrations of
    about 2-10 mg/kg. Igneous rocks tend to have low arsenic content, while
    shales, coals and volcanic rocks have higher levels. Arsenic is often found
    near deposits of sulfide minerals and ore deposits of metals such as tin
    and gold. In unconsolidated sediments, arsenic is primarily found in fine
    fractions, associated with metal oxides (especially iron) and to a lesser
    degree, clay minerals.
</p>
<p>
    Arsenic can occur in drinking water at levels up to several mg/L, either as
the reduced species As<sup>III</sup> (arsenite) or the oxidized form, As<sup>V</sup> (arsenate). As<sup>III</sup> is uncharged (H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>3</sub>) under natural conditions, and as such is more mobile than As<sup>V</sup> (H<sub>2</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> or HAsO<sub>4</sub>    <sup>2-</sup>).
</p>
<p>
    Contamination can occur in surface water, but is more common in
    groundwater. Rainwater contains negligible amounts of arsenic. Household
    burning of coal can also represent an important source of arsenic exposure,
    especially in parts of China (Finkelman et al., 1999; Guangqian et al,
    2007). There is an increasing body of evidence showing that rice from paddy
    fields irrigated with arsenic-contaminated water is also a significant
    source of arsenic. In some cases, the WHO recommended maximum tolerable
    daily levels of inorganic arsenic can be exceed through rice intake alone
    (Williams et al, 2006).
</p>
<p>
    Under most geochemical conditions, arsenic in aquifers remains tightly
    bound to sediments, and dissolved levels remain low. However, two
    geochemical environments have been recognized which can lead to high levels
    of dissolved arsenic even when concentrations in sediments are
    unremarkable: reducing conditions in alluvial aquifers, and arid oxidizing
    conditions (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002).
</p>
<h5>
    Reducing and oxidizing environments
</h5>
<p>
    Molecules are composed of atoms, which in turn are made up of protons,
    neutrons and electrons. An element always has the name number of protons
    and neutrons, but can have several different stable forms (called valences)
    with different numbers of electrons. A chemical reaction that involves the
    transfer of electrons from one atom to another is called a <em>redox </em>
    or <em>reduction-oxidation </em>reaction. Electrons have a negative charge,
    so when an atom accepts more electrons, its electrical charge is lowered
    and the atom is <em>reduced</em>. Atoms that can easily donate electrons to
    other atoms are strong <em>reductants</em>. Atoms that are good electron
    acceptors are called <em>oxidants </em>(so called because oxygen is a very
good electron acceptor), and atoms that lose electrons are called    <em>oxidized</em>. Whenever one species is reduced another must be
    oxidized.
</p>
<p>
    When alluvial aquifers are formed by river systems, a lot of organic matter
    is deposited along with sand, silt and clay. Bacteria in the aquifer can
    consume this organic matter, getting energy by oxidizing organic carbon to
    carbon dioxide. However, this requires a chemical oxidant to indirectly
    accept electrons from the carbon atoms. Bacteria in the aquifer will first
    use the strongest available electron acceptors, which in natural systems is
    oxygen. When all of the oxygen is used up, bacteria can use weaker oxidants
    such as nitrate or sulfate. As this happens, the aquifer becomes an
    increasingly reducing environment. Strongly reducing groundwaters are
    characterized by a lack of oxidants (oxygen, nitrate, sulfate) and the
    presence of reductants (ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane). In contrast,
    oxidizing conditions occur where there is a plentiful supply of oxygen,
    such as surface water or unsaturated sediments.
</p>
<p>
    Many metals are more soluble under reducing conditions. For example,
    ferrous iron (Fe<sup>II</sup>) is a strong reductant often present in
    groundwater. When pumped to the surface, it reacts with atmospheric oxygen
    and gives up one electron. Ferrous iron is oxidized to the much less
    soluble ferric iron (Fe<sup>III</sup>), and forms a reddish-brown
    precipitate. In the process, oxygen is reduced, forming water.
</p>
<p>
    In some areas, such as Bangladesh, a surface layer of fine clay or silt
    restricts transport of oxygen to young shallow aquifers, leading to the
    establishment of strongly reducing conditions. After bacteria have used up
    oxygen and nitrate, they can use weaker electron acceptors such as
    manganese oxide or iron oxide coatings on sediments. The solid oxides
    dissolve as they are reduced, releasing any bound arsenic to the
    groundwater. Iron oxides are a major reservoir of arsenic in sediments, so
    if they dissolve large amounts of arsenic may be liberated. In these
    waters, arsenic may be associated with high levels of iron, manganese,
    phosphate, ammonia, and alkalinity; and with low sulfate; and nitrate. pH
    is generally near neutral. As<sup>III</sup> dominates in these waters,
    though As<sup>V</sup> may also occur at significant levels. Bangladesh,
    West Bengal, Cambodia, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, Hungary and Romania provide
    examples of this type of environment.
</p>
<p>
    A completely different environment exists in internal geologic basins,
    where conditions can be oxidizing, with pH moderate to high. It is thought
    that elevated arsenic in these aquifers is caused by the high pH levels
    (&gt;8), which favour desorption of negatively charged arsenic species from
    oxide surfaces. This type of mobilization has been seen in Mexico, Chile,
    Argentina, and the USA.
</p>
<p>
    Arsenic causes a wide range of adverse health effects. As<sup>III</sup> is
somewhat more toxic in acute exposures, but because the low levels of As    <sup>V</sup> ingested in drinking water are reduced to As<sup>III</sup>
    internally, the two species can be considered equally toxic in drinking
    water. The first symptoms noticed are often skin lesions (keratosis,
    melanosis), but other effects can include weakness, diarrhoea, bronchitis,
    vascular disease and diabetes mellitus. The main health concerns, however,
    are cancers of the skin or internal organs (bladder, lung or kidney). The
    effects of low levels of arsenic exposure remain unclear, but many
    researchers believe that even trace levels could lead to unacceptable
    cancer rates. Because of the ongoing uncertainty about low-level effects,
    and the difficulties involved in measuring arsenic below 0.01 mg/L (or
    removing As to this level), WHO has set 0.01 mg/L as a provisional
    guideline value.
</p>
<p>
    There is no effective medical treatment for chronic arsenicosis, except for
    switching to an arsenic-free drinking-water source. However, palliative
    care such as application of ointments for cracked skin lesions can ease
    suffering. Chelation therapy is effective for short-term, acute poisoning,
    but not for long-term exposures.

    Barium occurs naturally in rock, with an average of 250 mg/kg in
    continental crust. It is positively charged in water (Ba<sup>2+</sup>) and
    typically occurs at less than 0.1 mg/L, though natural concentrations in
    groundwater can exceed 1 mg/L.
</p>
<p>
    There is no evidence that barium is carcinogenic, but chronic exposure can
    cause hypertension in humans, leading to the GV of 0.7 mg/L. Short-term
    exposure to high levels of barium can also cause gastrointestinal
    disturbances and muscular weakness.

<p>
    Boron concentration in rocks averages 10 mg/kg, with up to 100 mg/kg found
in sedimentary rocks, shales and coal deposits. Like arsenite (As<sup>III)</sup>, boron is predominantly neutral (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>) in water but can bear a negative charge (H<sub>2</sub>BO    <sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) at high pH (&gt;9).
</p>
<p>
    Boron levels in natural waters range widely, and are dependent on local
    geology and geochemical conditions, though local industrial inputs may be
    important. Ocean water contains relatively high levels of boron (4-5 mg/L),
    and boron in surface water is highly variable, though concentrations above
    1 mg/L are rare. Groundwater levels range more widely, from &lt; 0.3 to
    over 100 mg/L. Aquifers in internal basins may have elevated levels of
    boron due to evaporative concentration, and in coastal areas salt-water
    intrusion can lead to contamination of freshwater aquifers. Globally, the
    average concentration of boron in drinking water has been estimated to be
    between 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L. In most cases the main human exposure source is
    dietary, with a mean daily intake of about 1.2 mg.
</p>
<p>
    Boron is not a known carcinogen, and some evidence indicates that it may be
    an essential trace nutrient for humans. There are few studies involving
    human exposure, but animal studies have shown that ingestion can cause
    lower foetal weight and testicular damage, leading to the GV of 0.5 mg/L.
    This guideline value is provisional, due to the difficulty of removing
    boron from drinking water.

    Chromium is a trace metal that occurs in several forms in the environment.
The most important are the trivalent (Cr<sup>III</sup>) and hexavalent (Cr    <sup>VI</sup>) species. These two forms have very different physical
    properties and health impacts, but drinking-water standards are typically
    made for total chromium.
</p>
<p>
    Cr<sup>III</sup> is relatively non-toxic, and is in fact an essential trace
    element for humans. In water, the main dissolved species are the neutral
    Cr(OH)<sub>3</sub> and Cr(OH)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, though levels are
    quite low due to the low solubility of solid Cr(OH)<sub>3</sub>. Naturally
    occurring chromium is almost always present as Cr<sup>III</sup>, though
    relatively few data are available describing speciation of Cr in natural
    waters. In contrast, Cr<sup>VI</sup> has severe health impacts and occurs
    almost exclusively from industrial sources such as ferrochrome production,
    electroplating, pigment production, and tanning. Coal plants and waste
    incinerators can also release Cr<sup>VI</sup> to the environment. In water,
Cr<sup>VI</sup> forms negatively charged species (HCrO<sub>4</sub>    <sup>-</sup> or CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), which are relatively mobile.
</p>
<p>
    There is no evidence that Cr<sup>III </sup>is carcinogenic, but numerous
    occupational studies have shown that inhalation of Cr<sup>VI</sup> can
    cause lung cancer in humans. The health impacts of Cr<sup>VI</sup> ingested
    through drinking water are controversial. Some people advocate strict
    controls on Cr<sup>VI</sup> levels in water, since it is a known human
    carcinogen when inhaled. Others argue that Cr<sup>VI</sup> is completely
    converted to the harmless Cr<sup>III</sup> internally, and cite a number of
    epidemiological and animal studies that found no adverse effects of even
    relatively high exposures to Cr<sup>VI</sup> in drinking water (Flegal et
    al., 2001). Because of the ongoing controversy, WHO has kept the
provisional GV at 0.05 mg/L for total chromium (Cr<sup>III</sup> + Cr    <sup>VI</sup>).

<p>
    Fluoride, along with arsenic, is one of the most serious chemical
    contaminants that occurs naturally in drinking water. Fluoride is a fairly
    common element, with an average concentration of 300 mg/kg in the earth’s
    crust. Granite, granite gneisses and pegmatite can contain significant
    amounts of fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>). Fluoride can also be concentrated in
    coal or evaporite deposits such as gypsum and fluorite.
</p>
<p>
    In natural waters, fluoride is present as the anion F<sup>-</sup>. Surface
    water generally contains less than 0.3 mg/L, while groundwater can contain
    up to 10 mg/L, with much higher levels occasionally reported. High fluoride
    levels in groundwater are primarily caused by interactions with rock and
    sediments, and can occur in a wide range of geological environments,
    including the foothills of large mountains, areas of ancient marine
    deposits, and areas impacted by geothermal waters. In many cases, affected
    areas are characterized by a semi-arid climate, crystalline igneous rocks
    (e.g., granite), and alkaline soils. Fluoride concentrations have been
    observed to increase along groundwater flow lengths, due to rock-water
    interactions. Alkaline waters (pH &gt;7.5) and the presence of other anions
    (e.g., bicarbonate) increase fluoride mobility by displacing fluoride from
    clay and other mineral surfaces.
</p>
<p>
    Groundwater with high fluoride concentrations can be found in many areas of
    the world, including large parts of Africa, China, Mexico, the Middle East
    and southern Asia (India, Sri Lanka). One of the best-known high fluoride
    belts on land extends along the East
</p>
<p>
    African Rift from Eritrea to Malawi. Another belt extends from Turkey
    through Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India, northern Thailand and China. While
    the most common source of fluoride in drinking water is geological,
    considerable amounts may also be contributed from industrial sources or
    impurities in phosphorus fertilizers. Also, coal burning can release large
    amounts of fluoride to the environment, and is a significant source of
    domestic exposure in China.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike arsenic, fluoride is beneficial at low doses. Higher rates of dental
    caries are observed below approximately 0.5 mg/L, and in many countries
    fluoride is routinely added to drinking water (typically from 0.7-1.2 mg/L)
    to improve dental health. This protective effect increases up until about 2
    mg/L.
</p>
<p>
    However, ingestion of water containing more than approximately 1 mg/L F can
    lead to dental fluorosis, characterized by staining or pitting of dental
    enamel, in children under 6 years of age. At higher concentrations skeletal
    fluorosis may occur, involving stiffness and pain in joints. In severe
    cases, ligaments can calcify and bone structure may change, causing pain
    and impaired mobility or crippling. Some studies have shown a link between
    elevated fluoride levels and hip fractures, while others have found no link
    or even a protective effect. Ingestion of 14 mg/day poses a clear risk of
    skeletal fluorosis, and there is evidence suggestive of increased risk at 6
    mg/day. It is thought that fluorosis affects tens of millions of people
    across the world, with dental fluorosis being much more prevalent than the
    more serious skeletal form.
</p>
<p>
    The WHO GV for fluoride is set at 1.5 mg/L, because of the increased risk
    of dental fluorosis above this level, and of skeletal fluorosis at higher
    levels. It should be emphasized that in assessing exposure to fluoride, it
    is particularly important to consider climatic conditions, volume of water
    intake and intake of fluoride from other sources than drinking water.
</p>
<p>
    As part of its series addressing contaminants with significant adverse
    impact on public health, in 2006 WHO published a comprehensive monograph on
    fluoride addressing occurrence, health effects, testing and mitigation (see
    additional resources section below).

<p>
    Manganese is one of the most abundant metals in the earth’s crust. It can
    occur in a number of forms, with Mn<sup>II</sup> dominating in anaerobic
environments, and Mn<sup>IV</sup> in the presence of oxygen. Mn    <sup>IV</sup> forms an insoluble black precipitate, while Mn<sup>II</sup>
    is quite soluble as Mn<sup>+2</sup>. Surface water generally contains low
    levels of manganese (&lt; 0.1 mg/L). Anaerobic groundwater can contain much
    higher levels, even above 1 mg/L. Dissolved manganese is often associated
    with iron, which is also soluble under anaerobic conditions.
</p>
<p>
    Manganese is an essential element for humans, but a growing body of
    research suggests that exposure to high levels in drinking water can lead
    to adverse neurological effects (Wasserman et al, 2006). Because of
    possible health risks, WHO has set a GV of 0.4 mg/L. Normally, consumers
    are unlikely to drink water containing manganese at this level or higher
    because of a strong unpleasant metallic taste, however there are recorded
    situations, such as in Bangladesh, where people are regularly consuming
    water with manganese levels above the GV. Concentrations below 0.05–0.1
    mg/L are usually acceptable to consumers from a taste perspective but may
    sometimes still give rise to the deposition of black deposits in pipes (see
    2.4).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Molybdenum Mo GV 0.07 mg/L </em>
</p>
<p>
    Molybdenum is a relatively uncommon element in rocks and soils, with a
    global abundance of 1 mg/kg. Molybdenum is an essential trace nutrient for
    plants and animals, and is commonly used as an additive in agriculture. It
    is also used in the manufacture of steels, lubricants and pigments.
</p>
<p>
    Molybdenum is an essential trace element for humans, but there is
    relatively little information about possible toxic effects at higher
    exposures. Molybdenum levels in drinking water are generally below 0.01
    mg/L. Molybdenum, like arsenic and boron, forms a negatively charged
    species in water (MoO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and is relatively mobile in
    groundwater.
</p>
<p>
    The WHO GV is set on the basis of toxicological studies on animals. Cattle,
    in particular, are susceptible to molybdenum toxicity and show a range of
    symptoms including diarrhoea, greying of hair and lowered growth rate.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Selenium Se GV 0.01 mg/L </em>
</p>
<p>
    Selenium is a trace element in rocks, with an average concentration of less
    than 1 mg/kg. Sedimentary rocks (shales, limestone) may contain up to 100
    mg/kg, while levels up to several thousand mg/kg have been reported in some
    coal deposits. Industrial sources of selenium are minor, though mining
    operations can release significant amounts to the environment.
</p>
<p>
    Natural levels of selenium in drinking water are generally below 0.01 mg/L.
    A garlicky odour can be noted in waters containing 0.01 – 0.03 mg/L Se. The
    dominant species in water are all negatively charged: Se<sup>IV</sup>
    (selenite: HSeO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SeO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and
    Se<sup>VI</sup> (selenate: SeO<sub>4</sub>2 ).
</p>
<p>
    Selenium is thought to be an essential trace nutrient for humans, and a
    number of conditions have been linked to selenium deficiency, including
    Keshan disease, a heart condition which primarily affects children. The
    recommended daily intake for adults is about 1 µg/kg of body weight, which
    in most cases can be met through food intake.
</p>
<p>
    Human exposure to high levels of selenium (&gt; 500 µg/day) has been linked
    with liver and kidney damage and hair and fingernail loss. Drinking water
    typically contributes a minor amount of selenium compared to dietary
    intake. In zones containing selenium-rich coals, significant exposure may
    also occur from household coal burning.

<p>
    Uranium occurs naturally in rocks and sediments, with average concentration
    in soils and rocks of 3 mg/kg. Elevated levels are sometimes found in
    granites and shales. Drinking water typically contains up to 0.003 mg/L U,
    though levels of up to 0.78 mg/L have been reported (UNEP, 2003).
</p>
<p>
    Natural uranium occurs as a mixture of three isotopes: <sup>238</sup>U is
    the dominant fraction, with
</p>
<p>
    235 234
</p>
<p>
    U and U contributing 0.72% and 0.0054% respectively. All three isotopes
    decay by both alpha and gamma emissions. Depleted uranium (DU) contains
    only about a quarter as much <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>234</sup>U and as
    such is approximately 40% less radioactive than natural uranium.
</p>
<p>
    Although the decay of uranium isotopes (especially <sup>234</sup>U)
    produces radioactivity, the main public health threat of uranium arises
    from its chemical toxicity as a heavy metal, with the kidneys being the
    main target organ. Uranium is not known to be carcinogenic. In 2004 the WHO
    raised the provisional guideline value for uranium in drinking water from
    0.002 to 0.015 mg/L, to protect against kidney damage. A guideline value
    based on radiologic toxicity would be approximately ten times higher, at
    0.14 mg/L (WHO, 2001).
</p>
<h5>
    Depleted uranium in war zones
</h5>
<p>
    Depleted uranium (DU) is used in armor-penetrating ammunition, and in war
    zones spent rounds might lead to contamination of soil or water, even after
    a few years. UNEP has conducted extensive surveys in the Balkans, and was
    able to detect DU in soil and dust particles, seven years after the end of
the conflict. Transport of dissolved DU is very limited, as uranium (as UO    <sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>) adsorbs strongly to soil particles. Colloids or
    carbonate complexes can facilitate transport of uranium, and in one case,
    UNEP detected DU in a drinking-water well. The contamination (0.003 mg/L)
    was well below the WHO guideline value and radiologic contamination was
    negligible. Still, the finding shows that DU can contaminate drinking-water
    supplies, and it is possible that in other cases contamination might exceed
    the GV of 0.015 mg/L.
</p>
<p>
    The media have raised concerns that DU used in war zones may have
    contributed to a variety of adverse health effects among combatants and
    civilians, including leukemia, lung cancer, kidney and liver disorders,
    respiratory ailments, chronic fatigue, skin spotting and joint pain.
    However, according to UNEP, "at low levels of exposure, as expected in most
    post-conflict situations, the additional risk of cancer is thought to be
    very low. Importantly, any radiation effects based on DU occur only in the
    long-term, requiring typically 10-20 years before symptoms appear – if
    ever" (UNEP, 2003).
</p>
<p>
    Although epidemiological studies do not show a link between DU exposure and
    these conditions, UNEP recommends continued study – particularly in Iraq,
    following the US invasion – to identify "a number of remaining scientific
    uncertainties".
</p>
<p>
    Those most likely to be affected are combatants and small children, who may
    ingest DU when playing in or near DU impact sites. People may also be
    exposed to DU by stripping scrap metal off destroyed vehicles. WHO
    recommends preventing children from playing near such sites; monitoring of
    DU contamination in food and drinking water following conflict; clean-up
    operations in impact zones; disposal of DU following appropriate national
    or international recommendations; and raising public awareness about the
    risks of exposure to DU.

    Naturally occurring chemicals with no guideline value
</h6>
<p>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    A number of naturally occurring chemicals are not known to have negative
    health effects at levels found in drinking water. These include chloride,
    hardness (the sum of polyvalent metallic ions in water – the principal
    components of which are calcium and magnesium), hydrogen sulfide, pH,
    sodium, sulfate, total dissolved solids (TDS). Many of these compounds have
    aesthetic effects (see 2.4).
</p>
<p>
    Some evidence suggests that hardness in drinking water may be protective
    with respect to cardiovascular disease, but the data are inadequate to
    prove a causal association (see “Hardness” in 2.4). Vanadium can occur in
    natural waters at levels of up to 0.2 mg/L, and while limited evidence
    suggests that vanadium can affect animal and human health, available data
    do not warrant the setting of a guideline value.
</p>
<h3>
    2.3.2 Chemicals from industrial sources and human dwellings
</h3>
<p>
    Localized contamination of drinking-water resources can occur when
    chemicals are used in industries or in private households. Heavy metals,
    petroleum products, and chlorinated organic solvents are the main types of
    chemicals used in these settings. Heavy metals that occur naturally as well
    as in industrial settings are discussed in 2.3.1, while metals involved in
    drinking-water treatment or distribution (e.g., antimony, lead) are covered
    in 2.3.4.

    Mercury is used in the electrolytic production of chlorine; in electrical
    appliances such as dry-cell batteries, fluorescent light bulbs and
    switches; and in thermometers. Natural contamination can also occur in
    groundwater, but is rare.
</p>
<p>
    Ingestion of mercury can cause serious damage to the kidneys, brain, and
    nervous system. Organic mercury compounds are significantly more toxic than
    inorganic mercury, but almost all mercury in uncontaminated drinking water
    is thought to be in the inorganic form. The guideline value is now given

    Perchlorate (ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>), the explosive main ingredient of

    USEPA is contemplating setting a standard of 1 µg/L.
</p>
<p>
    Beryllium, a metal used in making metal alloys, can cause lung cancer when
    inhaled, but there are few data regarding its toxicity when ingested. WHO
    has not set a GV for beryllium, because it is unlikely to be found in
    drinking water. Likewise, WHO considers thallium, another toxic metal,
    unlikely to occur in drinking water.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Organic compounds </em>
</p>
<p>
    WHO lists GVs for a number of hydrocarbon products and solvents used in the

    because chronic ingestion can cause unhealthy deficiencies of trace metals
    such as zinc.

    In recent years it has been recognized that pharmaceutical and personal
    care products (PPCPs) can be released to the environment, particularly
    through wastewater streams. Many of these biochemically active compounds
    are not removed with conventional water treatment, and can potentially make
    their way into drinking-water supplies. In most cases concentrations in
    drinking water are too low to cause a direct threat to human health.
    However, these compounds can pose a considerable environmental threat, in
    some cases by mimicking natural hormones and interfering with normal growth
    in aquatic animals (Daughton and Ternes, 1999).

    2.3.3 Chemicals from agricultural activities
</h3>
<p>
    Most chemicals used in agriculture are either pesticides or fertilizers.
    Contamination of drinking-water resources may result following land
    application or from improper disposal.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
Nitrate and nitrite NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub>        <sup>-</sup>
    </em>
    50 and 3 mg/L<em> </em>
</p>
<p>
When nitrogen fertilizer is applied to crops, nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>    <sup>-</sup>) can filter into shallow aquifers or be washed into surface
    waters. Disposal of human or animal waste can also be a source of nitrate.
    Nitrate can be converted to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) by
    bacteria in surface water, groundwater, piped distribution systems or the
    body. Both nitrate and nitrite are very mobile in water, and groundwater
    typically contains higher levels than surface water. Since nitrate is used
    in all fertilizers, contamination of water resources is relatively common.
    Some drinking-water utilities use chloramines rather than free chlorine for
    disinfection, to avoid formation of trihalomethanes in distribution systems
    (2.3.4). In chloraminated systems, microbial activity in the distribution
    system may lead to sporadic nitrification episodes, resulting in elevated
    levels of nitrite.
</p>
<p>
    The main health concern regarding nitrate and nitrite is
    methaemoglobinaemia, or “bluebaby syndrome”, which can lead to death by
    asphyxiation amongst bottle-fed infants when contaminated water is used to
    prepare formula (or where infants drink contaminated water directly).
    Methaemoglobinaemia is rare in industrialized countries, but there are few
    data regarding its prevalence in the developing world, and contamination
    from agricultural sources is known to be common.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    When ingested, both nitrate and nitrite can oxidize blood haemoglobin (Hb)
    to methaemoglobin (metHb); nitrite is approximately ten times as potent as
    nitrate. MetHb cannot transport oxygen, and the oxygen-poor blood causes
    development of a blue colour in tissues (cyanosis). The abnormal colour is
    usually first noticed in the lips, followed by the fingers and toes, the
    face, and then the whole body. Infants below 6-12 months of age are
    particularly susceptible: their stomachs are less acidic than those of
    older children or adults, favoring the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. In
    addition, the haemoglobin of infants is more vulnerable to oxidation.
    Methaemoglobinaemia arises from short-term rather than chronic exposure to
    nitrate and nitrite.
</p>
<p>
    WHO GVs for nitrate and nitrite are set at 50 and 3 mg/L, respectively, to
    protect against methaemoglobinaemia in bottle-fed infants. In addition, the
    sum of the ratios of the concentrations of each to its guideline value
    should not exceed 1. For example, drinking water containing 30 mg/L nitrate
    and 1.5 mg/L nitrite would exceed the guideline value.
</p>
<p>
    There is some evidence that nitrite can react with amines or amides in the
    body to form nitrosamine, a known carcinogen. Chronic exposure to nitrite
    has produced changes in the adrenals, heart and lungs in laboratory animal
    studies. Accordingly, WHO provisionally recommends a GV of 0.2 mg/L nitrite
    for long-term exposure.

                    Nitrate and nitrite concentrations may be expressed either
                    in terms of the mass of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
                    ) or nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), or of total
                    nitrogen. Since nitrate and nitrite are 23% and 30%
                    nitrogen by weight, respectively, concentrations reported
                    in terms of total nitrogen are much lower. WHO and many
                    governments prefer reporting concentrations in terms of
                    nitrate or nitrite.

    <em>Pesticides </em>
</p>
<p>
    Pesticides may enter surface water or groundwater primarily as runoff
    following application to crops, though inappropriate disposal or accidental
    release can also cause contamination. The potential of a pesticide to
    contaminate drinking water is affected by its solubility and
    biodegradability; the method of application; and environmental factors such
    as soil, weather, season and proximity to water resources.
</p>
<p>
    Early pesticides were compounds of toxic metals such as arsenic, mercury,
    copper or lead. Use of such pesticides greatly decreased following the
    introduction of synthetic organic pesticides in the 1950s. The first
    organic pesticides were chlorinated hydrocarbons such as DDT, aldrin,
    dieldrin, chlordane, endrin, heptachlor, lindane and pentachlorophenol.
    These compounds are relatively insoluble, and tend to concentrate on soil
    surfaces instead of dissolving in water. However, they are resistant to
    biodegradation and can accumulate in food supplies, leading to toxic
    concentrations in some predator species. Accordingly, use of many of these
    chlorinated pesticides has been restricted over the last several decades.
    The most commonly used pesticides today include organophosphorus compounds
    (e.g., chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion) and carbamates (e.g.,
    aldicarb, carbaryl, carbofuran and oxamyl), both of which are relatively
    soluble and biodegradable. See Table 2.7 for common trade names of these
    and other pesticides.
</p>
<p>
    A number of pesticides have serious health impacts on humans and wildlife,
    including damage to internal organs and cancers. WHO has established
    guideline values for 32 pesticides: for detailed information see WHO GDWQ,
    section 8.5.3.
</p>
<p>
    Guideline values have also been set for several larvicides applied for
    public health (e.g., mosquito control). See section 2.3.5, and WHO GDWQ,
    section 8.5.5.

<h3>
    2.3.4 Chemicals from water treatment and distribution systems
</h3>
<p>
    The treatment and distribution of drinking water involves contact with
    chemicals and materials that may impart chemical residuals to the water.
    Residuals might be desired, in the case of disinfectants, or might be
    unwanted products of water treatment processes, or might result from
    corrosion and leaching of pipe materials.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Disinfectants </em>
</p>
<p>
    Free chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant, with a target
    residual concentration in the range of 0.2 to 1 mg/L. There are no specific
    adverse health effects of exposure to free chlorine, but WHO has
    conservatively set a GV of 5 mg/L, which is well above the taste and odour
    threshold for most consumers. Chloramines (a mixture of monochloramine,
    dichloramine and trichloramine formed when ammonia is present in
    chlorinated water) are also commonly used disinfectants, with a typical
    final concentration of 0.5-2 mg/L in finished waters. The GV for
    monochloramine is 3 mg/L, no GV is set for di- and trichloramine.
</p>
<p>
    Silver has a bacteriostatic effect and is sometimes used for emergency
    disinfection, or impregnated onto filter media to prevent bacterial growth.
    Excessive intake of silver can cause argyria, a condition in which skin and
    hair become discoloured, taking on a silvery hue. Argyria is not harmful,
    and there is no health-based GV for silver in drinking water.
</p>
<p>
    Other disinfectants include chlorine dioxide, iodine, and ozone. WHO has
    not set guideline values for these compounds either because they decay
    rapidly in water or data are inadequate to recommend a health-based
    guideline value.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Disinfectant by-products (DBPs) </em>
</p>
<p>
    All chemical disinfectants have the potential to produce unwanted organic
    or inorganic by-products that may be of health concern. The first
    recognized disinfection by-products (DBPs) were the trihalomethanes, which
    are produced by the reaction of free chlorine with natural organic matter.
    When bromide is present in the source water, brominated DBPs may be formed
    along with chlorinated ones. Other chlorination DBPs include haloacetic
    acids, halogenated ketones and haloacetonitriles. The concentration of
    chlorination DBPs tends to increase with water age.
</p>
<p>
    WHO has set GVs for 14 DBPs. Some of the DBPs have been found to be
    carcinogenic or cause reproductive or developmental effects in laboratory
    animals, but there is some uncertainty involving the risks to humans posed
    by chronic ingestion of DBPs.
</p>
<h5>
    Note on disinfection by-products
</h5>
<p>
    It is important to recognize that the health risk of developing cancer from
    long-term exposure to disinfection by-products is insignificant compared to
    the acute danger of ingesting pathogens from insufficiently disinfected
    water. While it is desirable to reduce DBP concentrations, this must be
    done while ensuring adequate disinfection and maintaining a disinfectant
    residual throughout the distribution system.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Contaminants from treatment chemicals </em>
</p>
<p>
    Polymer additives used in flocculation may contain residual levels of the
    monomers acrylamide and epichlorohydrin, which have been linked with tumour
    formation in rats. The WHO GVs for these compounds are 0.5 and 0.4 µg/L,
    respectively. Acrylamide and epichlorohydrin levels are controlled by
    product and dose specification.
</p>
<p>
    Aluminium salts are widely used coagulants in drinking-water treatment, and
    may result in elevated aluminium levels in treated water, particularly if
    filtration is inadequate. High aluminium residuals may cause an undesirable
    colour and turbidity in treated water or precipitation of flocs (small
    solid particles) in distribution systems. There has been a good deal of
    controversy about health risks associated with aluminium levels in drinking
    water, particularly regarding a possible link with Alzheimer’s disease
    (AD). The 1997 WHO EHC for aluminium concludes that:
</p>
<p>
    The relative risks for AD from exposure to aluminium in drinking-water
    above 100 µg/litre, are low (less than 2.0)…. Owing to the limitations of
    the animal data as a model for humans and the uncertainty surrounding the
    human data, a healthbased guideline value for aluminium cannot be derived
    at this time.
</p>
<p>
    The beneficial effects of the use of aluminium as a coagulant in water
    treatment are recognized. Taking this into account, and considering the
    health concerns about aluminium (i.e., its potential neurotoxicity), a
    practicable approach is proposed, based on optimization of the coagulation
    process in drinking-water plants using aluminium-based coagulants, to
    minimize aluminium levels in finished water. Under good operating
    conditions, concentrations of aluminium of 0.1 mg/litre or less are
    achievable in large water treatment facilities. For small facilities, 0.2
    mg/litre or less is a practicable level for aluminium in finished water
    (WHO, 1997a).
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, iron salts are used as coagulants but iron is not a parameter of
    health concern, and as such has no GV.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Contaminants from pipes and fittings </em>
</p>
<p>
    A number of organic compounds and heavy metals present in pipes and
    fittings can leach into drinking water during distribution. Metal leaching
    is most common in acid water, though alkaline waters with high carbonate
    levels may also attack some metals. Hard water provides some protection
    against metal corrosion, since scale deposits within pipes can provide a
    physical barrier between the water and the pipe wall.
</p>
<p>
    Natural waters and treated drinking water usually contain almost no lead.
    However, pipes in distribution systems and houses may well be made of lead,
    or may be joined together using lead solder, especially in older dwellings.
    Lead is a general toxicant that accumulates in the skeleton. The WHO GV of
    10 µg/L is set to protect infants and children on the basis that lead is a
    cumulative poison and that there should be no accumulation of body burden
    of lead.
</p>
<p>
    Corrosion of plumbing can also lead to high copper concentrations in
    drinking water. Copper is an essential nutrient, but excessive copper can
    cause gastrointestinal problems in some users, and some sub-populations may
    be genetically susceptible to metabolic disorders of copper homeostasis.
    Because of uncertainties regarding the effects on sensitive populations,
    the WHO GV of 2000 µg/L is provisional. Other heavy metals that can leach
    into drinking water include antimony and nickel (GV 20 µg/L and 70 µg/L
    respectively), which are present as alloys in some taps and fittings.
</p>
<p>
    Coal-tar is sometimes used to coat drinking-water pipes or storage tanks to
    protect against corrosion. This practice can introduce polyaromatic
    hydrocarbons (PAHs) into the treated water. A GV of 0.7 µg/L has been set
    for the PAH benzo[a]pyrene. Unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes
    may leach vinyl chloride (GV 0.3 µg/L), a human carcinogen, into drinking
    water.
</p>
<p>
    Asbestos-cement pipes can release asbestos fibres into drinking water.
    Although asbestos is a known human carcinogen when inhaled, there is no
    consistent evidence that it is carcinogenic when ingested, so no GV has
    been set for asbestos in drinking water.
</p>
<h3>
    2.3.5 Pesticides used in water for public health purposes
</h3>
<p>
    A number of pesticides are used to control vectors such as mosquitoes. In
    some cases pesticides used for vector control may enter drinking water
    supplies, or even be added deliberately. There are currently five
    larvicides recommended by WHO for addition to drinking water: temephos,
methoprene, pyriproxyfen, permethrin and    <em>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</em> (see table 2.7 for trade names
    of some of these chemicals). Of these, only pyriproxyfen has been reviewed.
    It was found to be neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic, and given a GV of
    0.3 mg/L.
</p>
<p>
    Other pesticides (e.g. chlorpyrifos, DDT) which are not recommended for
    direct addition to drinking water may be used for control of aquatic
    vectors, and could potentially enter drinking water.
</p>
<h5>
    DDT and mosquito control
</h5>
<p>
    Malaria causes more than 300 million acute illnesses and kills at least one
    million people every year. Ninety percent of deaths due to malaria occur in
    Africa, south of the Sahara, and most deaths occur in children under the
    age of 5. Although agricultural use of DDT has been banned in most
    countries since the 1970s, indoor spraying of DDT can be highly effective
    and a comparatively inexpensive form of malaria control. For many
    malariaaffected countries, responsible DDT use is a vital strategy for
    preventing malaria transmission and controlling epidemics. In some cases,
    the introduction of less effective DDT substitutes has compromised the
    efficacy of malaria-control programmes (WHO, 2007b). Consequently, a 2007
    WHO position paper states that DDT should continue to be used for indoor
    spraying in a controlled fashion until cost-effective alternatives are
    available (WHO, 2007b).
</p>
<h3>
    2.3.6 Cyanobacterial toxins
</h3>
<p>
    An excess of nutrients, primarily phosphorus and in some cases nitrogen,
    can cause algal blooms in surface waters. The cyanobacteria (also known as
    blue-green algae) that are primarily responsible for these blooms produce a
    wide variety of biochemically active toxins, which can cause human health
    problems if ingested. Cyanobacterial toxins have only recently been
    recognized as a potential threat to the integrity of drinking water, and
    the magnitude of health impacts remains unclear. Because of the large
    number of cyanobacterial toxins, and the difficulty of laboratory analysis,
    chemical monitoring for these toxins is not recommended. Rather, source
    waters should be monitored for evidence of blooms, or bloom-forming
    potential. A provisional GV of 1 µg/L has been established for one of the
    more toxic and common toxins, microcystin-LR.
</p>
<p>
    A WHO monograph describes in detail the state of knowledge regarding toxic
    cyanobacteria in drinking water (Chorus and Bartram, 1999).
</p>
<h5>
    Gastro-enteritis epidemic in the area of the Itaparica Dam
</h5>
<p>
    A severe epidemic of diarrhoeal disease in Brazil’s Bahia state followed
    the flooding of the newly constructed Itaparica Dam reservoir in 1988. Some
    2000 gastro-enteritis cases, 88 of which resulted in death, were reported
    over a 42-day period. Clinical data and water sample tests were reviewed,
    blood and faecal specimens from patients were subjected to bacteriological,
    virological and toxicological testing and drinking-water samples were
    examined for micro-organisms and heavy metals. The results demonstrated
    that the source of the outbreak was water impounded by the dam and pointed
    to toxin produced by cyanobacteria present in the water as the responsible
    agent. No other infectious agent or toxin was identified, and cases
    occurred in patients who had been drinking only boiled water. The cases
    were restricted to areas supplied with drinking water from the dam (Chorus
    and Bartram, 1999).
</p>
<h2>
    2.4 Physical and aesthetic water quality
</h2>
<p>
    Consumers of drinking water tend to base their perceptions of
    drinking-water quality on easily observed parameters such as visual
    appearance, taste and odour. This can lead to ingestion of water that is
    microbiologically or chemically unsafe, but appears clean. Conversely, a
    water of high microbiological and chemical quality with regard to health
    impacts may still appear dirty or have an unpleasant taste or odour, and
    can be rejected by consumers. The supply of aesthetically unpleasant water
    can and often does lead to the use of less safe, but more appealing, water
    resources; or may compel users to invest in costly (and possibly
    unreliable) alternatives such as bottled water or domestic water treatment
    devices. Thus, even in the absence of a direct threat to public health,
    water suppliers should seek to produce and deliver drinking water that is
    acceptable to consumers.
</p>
<p>
    The concentration at which a parameter is objectionable to users will vary
    according to social, economic and cultural considerations. Therefore WHO
    does not set Guideline Values at specific levels, but rather indicates a
    typical concentration that might give rise to complaints from consumers.
    For detailed information see the WHO GDWQ Chapter 10.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Taste and odour </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    Unpleasant tastes and odours can arise from inorganic or organic compounds
    in water sources, occurring naturally or as a result of human activity. An
    unpleasant taste or odour may indicate a failure of drinking-water
    treatment, and should be investigated to ensure that microbial and chemical
    quality of the water is not compromised.
</p>
<p>
    A major cause of taste and odour complaints is chemical disinfection.
    Utilities with large distribution systems may apply large chlorine doses to
    ensure a residual throughout the distribution system. In community or
    household settings, it can be difficult to ensure a consistent chlorine
    dose while maintaining the desired residual, typically near 0.5 mg/L. Above
    a residual free chlorine concentration of between 0.6 and 1.0 mg/L there is
    an increasing likelihood of complaints from consumers. Chloramines can also
    give rise to taste and odour problems.
</p>
<p>
    A second major cause of taste and odour problem is dissolved inorganic
    compounds, especially metals. Naturally occurring iron and manganese
    commonly occur in groundwater; these may react with oxygen after exposure
    to air to form insoluble precipitates. Either as dissolved ions or as small
    particles, iron and manganese give a strong metallic taste to water. Iron
    is usually not detectable by users below 0.3 mg/L, and in some cases higher
    concentrations are acceptable. Manganese levels below 0.1 mg/L (well below
    the health-based GV of 0.4 mg/L) are usually acceptable to users.
</p>
<p>
    Metals can also enter drinking water from pipes and fittings. Although
    copper can give rise to taste problems, the taste should be acceptable at
    the health-based provisional guideline value of 2 mg/L. Zinc levels above 3
    mg/L can impart an undesirable astringent taste to water. Drinking water
    usually contains much lower levels of zinc, though older galvanized
    plumbing materials can leach zinc. There is no health-based GV for zinc.
</p>
<p>
    Sulfate in drinking water can cause a noticeable taste above concentrations
    of about 250 mg/L. In the absence of oxygen and free chlorine, bacteria can
    convert sulfate to hydrogen sulfide, which causes a distinctive
    “rotten-egg” odour at concentrations as low as 0.05 mg/L. There are no
    health-based GVs for sulfate or sulfide.
</p>
<p>
    Total dissolved solids (TDS) is a measure of salinity that can have an
    important effect on the taste of drinking-water. The palatability of water
    with a TDS level of less than 600 mg/L is generally considered to be good;
    drinking water becomes significantly unpalatable at TDS levels greater than
    1000 mg/L. Dissolved ions increase the electrical conductivity (EC) of
    water, which is easily measured with a meter, so EC is often used as a
    surrogate for TDS. EC in microSiemens per centimetre (µS/cm) usually ranges
    from 1 to 2 times the TDS in mg/L. Excessive pumping or lack of rainfall in
    coastal areas can lead to saltwater intrusion, increasing the salinity in
    freshwater aquifers. Groundwater with high TDS may be too saline to be
    accepted by users; when drilling new wells salinity should be tested as
    early as possible, and certainly before well completion.
</p>
<p>
    Sodium and chloride are principal components of TDS, and either ion can
    give water an unpleasantly salty taste at concentrations above 200-300
    mg/L, depending on the associated counterion. Although some people with
    hypertension are sensitive to sodium, no health-based GV has been derived
    for either sodium or chloride.
</p>
<p>
    The third major class of taste and odour compounds is organic material.
    Bacteria and fungi in surface water reservoirs can produce a number of
    organic compounds that can impart unpleasant earthy/musty odours to water.
    Geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) are of particular concern, since they
    can cause acceptability problems at trace levels (below 10 ng/L, or
    0.000010 mg/L). These compounds are most likely to be found in drinking
    water following algal bloom events.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, synthetic organic compounds can impart tastes and odours to water.
    For many organic compounds, health-based GVs are below taste and odour
    thresholds. However, a number of low-molecular weight hydrocarbons found in
    petroleum oils and solvents may impart a very unpleasant “diesel-like”
    odour to water at levels well below health-based GVs.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Appearance </em>
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, drinking water should be free from colour and particulate matter.
</p>
<p>
    Most consumers can detect colours above 15 true colour units (TCU), though
    more coloured waters may be acceptable according to local preference.
    Dissolved organic matter such as humic and fulvic acids is the main
    component of colour. Highly coloured waters may indicate a high potential
    for formation of byproducts following disinfection.
</p>
<p>
    Turbidity, or cloudiness, is caused by suspended particles in water.
    Turbidity may result from insufficient filtration during water treatment or
    mobilization of sediments, mineral precipitates or biomass within the
    distribution system. Changes in turbidity following rainfall may indicate
    contamination with untreated surface water, and may contain pathogens. High
    levels of turbidity can shield pathogens from disinfectants, so effective
    disinfection requires that turbidity is less than 1 nephelometric turbidity
    unit (NTU); ideally, median turbidity should be below 0.1 NTU. Higher
    turbidity levels may be acceptable to consumers, but because of the
    possible screening of pathogens it is recommended that turbidity in treated
    water should be kept below 1 NTU.
</p>
<p>
    Dissolved metals may contribute to colour in drinking water, and can stain
    laundry and plumbing fixtures. Metal precipitates may also form coatings on
    pipe walls that can slough off as fine particulates, contributing to
    turbidity. Iron and manganese above 0.3 and 0.1 mg/L, respectively, can
    cause staining, and may impact colour and turbidity at lower levels. Foods
    cooked in water (e.g., rice, plantains) containing high levels of iron and
    manganese may become unacceptably discoloured. Dissolved copper can stain
    laundry and sanitary ware at levels above 1 mg/L, which is below the taste
    threshold for most consumers, as well as the health-based GV of 2 mg/L.
</p>
<p>
    High levels of aluminium in water following drinking-water treatment can
    lead to deposition of aluminium hydroxide flocs in distribution systems,
    and can interfere with discolouration of water by iron (see the discussion
    on contaminants from treatment chemicals in section 2.3.4 for more
    information on aluminium).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Hardness (calcium and magnesium) </em>
</p>
<p>
    Hardness is the sum of polyvalent metallic ions in water. Calcium and
    magnesium are the principal components, and hard waters are most common in
    groundwater, especially when derived from limestone, dolomite or chalk
    aquifers.

    Hard water can be unacceptable to consumers. Hard water requires more soap
    to produce a lather, and can form scale deposits on pipes, basins, pots and
    hot water heaters (scale formation increases at higher temperatures). In
    contrast, soft water can lead to corrosion of metal pipes and elevated
    levels of heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, lead and zinc in drinking
    water.
</p>
<p>
    The taste threshold for the calcium ion is in the range of 100–300 mg/L and
    the taste threshold for magnesium is probably lower. In some instances,
    consumers tolerate water hardness in excess of 500 mg/L. Soft water may
    also have a salty taste. There is some evidence that consumption of hard
    water is linked with lower rates of cardiovascular disease, but data are
    inadequate to show a causal relationship.

<p>
    <em>Corrosiveness </em>
</p>
<p>
    Corrosion is a complex process in which metals are oxidized through a
    variety of chemical, physical and biological reactions. Iron pipes and
    handpumps used in drinkingwater systems are subject to corrosion, which can
    cause breakage or greatly reduce the efficiency of water transmission
    (McNeill and Edwards, 2001). A second important effect of corrosion is its
    negative impact on drinking-water quality: the high iron (and in some
    cases, zinc) levels resulting from corrosion can lead to consumer
    complaints of colour, turbidity or staining of laundry and sanitary ware.
</p>
<p>
    Corrosion can occur under a variety of water conditions, but soft, acid
    waters tend to be the most aggressive (corrosive). Dissolved copper or high
    salinity can enhance some kinds of corrosion, but dissolved calcium and
    alkalinity can reduce corrosion by forming passive calcium carbonate
    coatings on metal surfaces. To some extent, corrosiveness can be predicted
    with corrosion indices, but because of the complexity of the corrosion
    process, metal pumps or pipes should be tested under field conditions in
    areas where corrosion is common. WHO recommends a pH of 6.5 or higher in
    drinking water to prevent corrosion. On the other hand, pH should be kept
    below 8.0 to allow more effective disinfection with chlorine.
</p>
<h5>
    Handpump corrosion in West Africa
</h5>
<p>
    In 1987 an investigation was conducted to identify the cause of well-known
    red water problems encountered by many handpump users in West Africa. A
    geochemical survey showed that natural groundwater quality was generally
    high, with iron levels typically below 1 mg/L, but that approximately half
    of the water samples had a pH below 6.5. However, water delivered from
    handpumps contained excessive levels of iron (over 20 mg/L in many cases)
    and most consumers were unwilling to drink water containing 5 mg/L iron or
    more.
</p>
<p>
    The investigation concluded that aggressive water, especially with a pH
    &lt; 6.5, was corroding handpump rods and rising mains. Up to two-thirds of
    handpump failures in the study area were directly or indirectly caused by
    corrosion, which even damaged galvanized rising mains and pump rods. As
    newly installed handpumps corroded, they produced red water that was
    unacceptable to users: over half of users reported that water taste
    deteriorated within a few months of installation.
</p>
<p>
    Water quality was improved somewhat by encouraging villagers to use the
    handpumps more frequently. Although intensive and regular use of the
    handpumps does not stop corrosion, it significantly reduces red water
    problems by continuous flushing of corrosion products. When installing new
    wells in the project area, use of corrosion-resistant (e.g., stainless
    steel) rising mains was recommended for use below the water table. Less
    expensive galvanized materials could still be used for rising mains that
    will not be immersed in water (Langenegger, 1994).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Temperature </em>
</p>
<p>
    Consumers often tend to prefer cool water to warm water. This has been
    identified as a possible constraint for water treatment systems that rely
    on boiling or heating water, but in practice it does not appear to be a
    major problem (EAWAG, 2007; Islam and Johnston, 2006). High temperatures
    can also negatively impact water quality by enhancing microorganism growth,
    and may increase taste, odour, colour and corrosion problems.
</p>
<h2>
    2.5 Radiological water quality
</h2>
<p>
    The contribution of drinking water to overall radioactive exposure is very
    small (typically less than 5%), and is principally due to the presence of
    naturally occurring elements in the uranium and thorium decay series.
</p>
<p>
    Radioactive materials can be grouped into alpha, beta and photon emitters
    based on the particles or energy they emit. Rather than setting guideline
    values for individual radioactive compounds, WHO has set screening
    guideline values at 0.1 Bq/L for gross alpha activity and 1 Bq/L for gross
    beta activity. (The standard unit of radioactivity is the becquerel, where
    1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second. Alpha particles consist of two protons
    and two neutrons, while beta particles are much smaller, and are equivalent
    to electrons.) Most alpha emitters occur naturally in the environment while
    beta emitters are principally products of the nuclear industry. If the
    screening GV for radiation in a water sample is exceeded, the radionuclides
    responsible for the radiation should be identified, and their individual
    activity concentrations measured.
</p>
<p>
    Nearly half of the total natural radiation exposure we receive comes from a
    radioactive gas, radon, which is emitted by naturally occurring uranium,
    thorium and radium in rocks and soil. As radon (an alpha emitter) is quite
    volatile, radon concentrations in air are much higher than in water. Over
    99% of radon exposure occurs from inhalation of radon naturally present in
    air, rather than from ingestion of drinking water.
</p>
<p>
    Groundwater typically contains more radioactivity than surface water.
    Radium, a product of both uranium and thorium decay, is often the principal
    component of gross alpha activity in groundwater. Aquifers in granite or
    phosphate rocks can have elevated levels of uranium, and therefore thorium,
    radon and radium.

    Water Quality Monitoring and Surveillance<em> </em>
</h1>
<p>
    Safe water supplies are the result of informed and active governments and
    communities, properly constructed and managed systems, and the protection
    of systems from sources of contamination. Water quality monitoring and
    surveillance ensures that water continues to be safe throughout the life of
    the system and through changes in environmental conditions, watershed
    status and pollution patterns.
</p>
<p>
    In many countries there is a trend towards the decentralization of
    government services and of water system management. Water quality
    monitoring and surveillance must follow this trend – technologies and
    methodologies for water quality control must increasingly be applicable at
    the community level. While national level activities such as strengthening
    legislation and developing supportive policies continue to be essential,
    governments and support agencies like UNICEF must stress the empowerment of
    community and local governments with the necessary tools and knowledge to
    assure the quality of their own water supplies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Water quality monitoring and surveillance systems are an essential
    component of water safety plans (Chapter 4) and should be developed
    together with other components of the plan.
</p>
<h2>
    3.1 Methodologies
</h2>
<h3>
    3.1.1 Rapid assessments and surveys
</h3>
<p>
    As the importance of water quality issues becomes increasingly recognized
    by national governments and external support agencies, special water
    quality assessment programmes are becoming more commonplace. Typically two
    types of rapid assessment are being carried out: comprehensive surveys of a
    range of key quality parameters and specific surveys of a single parameter.
</p>
<p>
    A multi-parameter assessment has several goals. It is used to establish a
    water quality baseline, to help predict quality patterns and trends, to
    promote the establishment or improvement of routine monitoring systems and
    to influence the development of policy and legislation related to water
    source construction and national water quality standards.
</p>
<p>
    In many developing countries good water quality data are not available,
    especially in rural and poor urban areas. Data are either not collected at
    all, collected sporadically or recorded in a format that makes it difficult
    to analyze (such as handwritten logs filed in provincial or district level
    government offices). A rapid assessment will often provide the very first
    set of usable information on water quality in a country. In most cases,
    such an assessment is a one-off event, but it can form the basis for the
    design of a national routine monitoring and surveillance programme.
</p>
<p>
    A single-parameter assessment is usually carried out in response to an
    existing public health problem caused by a specific contaminant. The most
    common examples of this are the arsenic testing programmes in Asia. These
    surveys are used to quickly assess the extent of the contamination and the
    types or characteristics of the water sources affected. The information is
    used to help design mitigation programmes and to inform people about which
    specific sources, or type of sources, should be avoided.
</p>
<p>
    Most multi- and single-parameter assessments are carried out on a sample
    basis (blanket arsenic surveys – where every source is tested in a
    particular area because of the unpredictable pattern of arsenic
    contamination – are an exception). There are several different ways of
    choosing statistically valid random samples, and it is beyond the scope of
    this handbook to explain them all. UNICEF and other organizations recommend
    the use of a cluster sample approach: the collection of water quality
    samples from groups of water sources that are close to one another. There
    are two main reasons for using this methodology: it is the same method by
    which most water, sanitation and public healthrelated information is
    gathered in developing countries (through the UNICEF/WHO Joint
</p>
<p>
    Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, the UNICEF Multiple
    Indicator Cluster Surveys and the USAID-supported Demographic Health
    Surveys), and it is logistically much easier and therefore less expensive
    and less time-consuming than other methods.
</p>
<p>
    The choice of which water quality parameters to include in a
    multi-parameter assessment is dictated by the relative seriousness of a
    parameter in terms of health impact, whether or not a parameter is known
    (or suspected) to be present in a country and the existence of human
    activities that are known to potentially cause pollution of water supplies.
    Parameters affecting the acceptability of drinking water to users should
also be prioritized. National standards and the WHO    <em>Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality </em>(see section 2.1) and any
    previous water quality surveys or data are important resources for defining
    the parameter set for a new assessment. Another resource is the methodology
    and parameter set developed through a recent rapid assessment pilot project
    conducted in six countries and replicated in an additional two countries
    under the auspices of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water
    Supply and Sanitation (JMP, 2008).
</p>
<h5>
    Selection of parameters for assessment
</h5>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The first priority in assessing drinking-water quality must be to check
    microbiological quality. This can be done by measuring, at a minimum, the
    “essential parameters” of drinking-water quality: faecal coliforms (or E.
    coli), and, when assessing treated water, chlorine residual, pH and
    turbidity (WHO, 2006, Section 4.2). Other important priorities are the
    aesthetic quality of the water and contamination with chemicals of known
    health risk. Table 3.1 lists parameters in order of decreasing priority.
    Level 1 parameters should be measured in any assessment, while level 2 and
level 3 represent increasingly sophisticated and complete assessments.    <strong><em> </em></strong>

    3.1.2 National monitoring and surveillance systems
</h3>
<p>
    Water quality monitoring refers to the routine and systematic inspection
    and testing of water supply systems by the water provider and, in some
    cases, by the consumer. In piped systems it involves the regular analysis
    of parameters related to both the quality of the water (including the
    quality of the intake water) and the functioning of the system itself (such
    as chlorine levels at tapstands in systems where chlorine is used and
    hydraulic pressure in pipelines). The key purpose of monitoring is to
    ensure that when a problem appears, system managers can take appropriate
    measures to correct it before unsafe water is delivered to the consumer.
</p>
<p>
    In point sources, including both community and household systems,
    monitoring is often limited to sanitary inspections of water quality
    control measures such as well aprons and rooftop rainwater harvesting
    filters (see 3.1.4). It can also include some direct analysis of water
quality through the use of field instruments (including, notably, H    <sub>2</sub>S strip vials for testing microbiological quality – see 3.2).
    In most cases, monitoring is carried out by system owners or designated
    community members, and not by private or government technicians.
</p>
<p>
    Water quality surveillance refers to the oversight of water systems and
    water providers by independent agencies to ensure the consistent safety and
    acceptability of all national drinking-water supplies. All countries should
    have, or be working towards, a functional national water quality
    surveillance system. Ideally, the surveillance system should be based on
    established water quality standards and a national legislative and
    regulatory framework (see 2.1). In practice, many countries have neither
    national standards nor specific water quality legislation in place. In such
    cases, systems can be established that make use of existing legislation
    (e.g., in the areas of food safety, child rights, and health and welfare)
    and interim water quality standards. UNICEF and its partners (especially
    WHO) can be instrumental in supporting the establishment of a surveillance
    system along with national standards and legislation.
</p>
<p>
    In practice the agency responsible for surveillance (e.g., a national
    ministry of health, a provincial water board or a municipal public health
    department) works closely with water providers, assisting them in the
    establishment of good systems management practices, reliable quality
    control processes and remedial procedures. The surveillance system should
    also provide a channel for third party audits of water supply systems,
    periodic testing of point sources in communities and mechanisms for
    notification and response in water quality emergencies (e.g., during a
    cholera outbreak). Finally, the surveillance system should have provisions
    for facilitating legal action in cases where it is necessary.
</p>
<p>
    Water supply and surveillance agencies have an obligation to share water
    quality information with consumers. In some cases this obligation is
    formally defined in information rights legislation and in other cases it is
    implied. However, such rights do not ensure that people will be informed.
    Consumers may not be aware of their rights and some government agencies may
    be reluctant to provide the information. Even when attempts are made to
    inform people about water quality, poor communication infrastructure, large
    distances, limited budgets and illiteracy often mean that people are
    unaware of quality problems and continue to drink unsafe water.
</p>
<p>
    Surveillance agencies must develop communication strategies to ensure that
    water quality messages are effectively transmitted to consumers (see
    Chapter 6). These strategies include the dissemination of information in
    formats understood by communities, establishing dialogues with communities
    through meetings and other means, involving local government bodies and
    NGOs, and in some cases, directly identifying problem sources (see box).
    UNICEF often has a role in this area, using its experience in programme
    communication to support these efforts.
</p>
<p>
    Monitoring and surveillance programmes should not be allowed to become
    pointless exercises in data collection alone. The purpose of monitoring and
    surveillance is to ensure water systems are protected and, if problems
    emerge, to be the stimulus for corrective measures. There is little point
    in monitoring if there is no intention or capacity to act on the results.
    This means that monitoring and surveillance efforts should be fully
    incorporated into sectoral programmes at national, sub-national and
    community levels.
</p>
<h5>
    Communicating water quality information: marking wells
</h5>
<p>
    In the arsenic-affected countries in Asia, governments – in some cases with
    UNICEF support – are implementing blanket testing programmes to establish
    the status of each and every tubewell in suspect areas. Experience suggests
    that the most effective way of ensuring that contaminated wells are
    identified as such by consumers is by physically marking the wells –
    usually by painting the handpumps red or attaching a red band to the pump
    base – and implementing a comprehensive communication campaign to associate
    the marked wells with the health risks of arsenic. As a rights-based
    organisation, UNICEF should support efforts that inform and educate
    consumers about the safety of their water supplies (see also Chapter 6).
</p>
<h3>
    3.1.3 Community-based surveillance
</h3>
<p>
    National monitoring and surveillance systems are usually less effective in
    rural areas and poor urban areas than in cities and towns. Water Safety
    Plans, as discussed in the 2004 WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality
    (and elsewhere, see Chapter 4), are more difficult to implement although
    they are relevant to such communities. Poor communication and
    transportation infrastructure, lack of resources, dispersed point source
    water systems and weak local government agencies contribute to this.
    Perhaps most importantly, poor and rural communities tend to have low
    awareness levels of the importance of water quality and thus do not
    typically demand water quality surveillance services.
</p>
<p>
    Community-based surveillance systems are important in two ways: they extend
    the reach of national surveillance systems to poor and rural areas, and
    they directly involve the primary stakeholders in communities, thus helping
    to raise awareness on water quality. Improved local awareness and
    surveillance leads ultimately to safer water supplies.
</p>
<p>
    Programmes to initiate and encourage community-based surveillance should
    include five components: awareness-raising on the importance of water
    quality; training of community members and source owners on sanitary
inspection techniques (see 3.1.4); provision of field kits (including H    <sub>2</sub>S strips, see box) for water quality testing; establishment of
    links between the community and the national surveillance system and the
    development of a system for water quality problem remediation that involves
    both community-based interventions and, when necessary, interventions from
    government water services. In some cases, water quality surveillance can be
    introduced through ongoing hygiene education and promotion programmes and
    in all cases, awarenessraising on hygiene and water quality should go hand
    in hand (see Chapter 6).
</p>
<p>
    The most important outcome of community-based surveillance is a
    “knowledgeempowered” community, that is, people with the knowledge to act
    as their own advocates for improved water services and the tools to improve
    the quality of their own water supplies.
</p>
<h5>
    Using H<sub>2</sub>S kits for community-based water quality surveillance
</h5>
<p>
    H<sub>2</sub>S kits (described in more detail in 3.2) are simple and
    inexpensive tests for bacteriological contamination of water supplies.
    While not as accurate as laboratory tests, they provide qualitative
    information on whether or not sources are likely to be contaminated with
    faecal material. Even in countries with functioning water quality
    surveillance systems, laboratory microbiological testing of small community
    water supplies is rarely carried out – this technology has the potential to
    help change the situation.
</p>
<p>
    The test is very appropriate for community-based surveillance: it is
    inexpensive (as low as $0.20), portable, simple and provides a visible test
    result. In the test, prepared vials are filled with sample water and if the
    water turns black after 24 hours the source is likely to be contaminated.
    The vials are most commonly used in a simple presence/absence format, which
    provides no information about the degree of contamination. It is possible
    to use H<sub>2</sub>S kits in a Most Probable Number format, but this is
    rarely done. H<sub>2</sub>S testing was developed in India and is gaining
    popularity in other countries including South Africa, Ethiopia, Bangladesh,
    Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. In Thailand, for example, the Ministry of
    Public Health manufactures H<sub>2</sub>S kits and other simple
    presence/absence kits for use within their own monitoring programme and for
    sale to consumers at low cost. H<sub>2</sub>S testing has also been used in
    emergency situations to rapidly assess the safety of water sources. In some
    cases the test vials are provided through pilot projects, in others they
    are available in the marketplace. In Vietnam, the vials are sold in some
    pharmacies.
</p>
<p>
    The tests can be used to empower communities with direct knowledge of the
    quality status of their own water points. This knowledge can be used to
    assess the quality of sources constructed by government or the private
    sector and to demand improvements or replacements when necessary. The
    technology allows communities to test sources throughout the year and to
    take remedial action, such as chlorination, when necessary.
</p>
<p>
    H<sub>2</sub>S kits are available from international chemical companies
    like Hach, and increasingly from manufacturers and distributors in
    developing countries. However, H<sub>2</sub>S kits remain an emerging
    technology, and kit performance should be carefully evaluated and test
    results checked against more conventional laboratory methods.
</p>
<h3>
    3.1.4 Sanitary inspections
</h3>
<p>
    The analysis of water quality parameters alone cannot provide a complete
    picture of the water quality status of a community and its water supply
    systems. Periodic quality testing is only a snapshot: it provides limited
    information on the source of contamination and it can miss important
    seasonal quality fluctuations. Remediation of actual and potential water
    quality problems is only possible if information is available on the
    sources and pathways of contaminants, and this information can only be
    provided by sanitary inspections. Thus, sanitary inspections are an
    integral component of rapid assessments, routine monitoring and community-
    based systems (as well as water safety planning – see box in section 4.4).
</p>
<p>
    A sanitary inspection is an on-site appraisal by trained people of actual
    and potential contamination hazards and pathways in and around water supply
    systems. Hazards are contamination sources that may be a risk to water
    systems, such as latrines too close to shallow point sources or stagnant
    surface water. Pathways are routes through which contamination may occur,
    such as leaking pipes or cracked well aprons. Hazards and pathways can be
    indirect or intermittent, such as a broken gate that allows animals into
    well enclosures or erosion that uncovers buried pipelines. Sanitary
    inspections focus on microbiological contamination sources. However, in
    some cases inspections can identify chemical hazards from local industries
    or agricultural activity such as intensive fertilization near a surface
    water source intake or effluents from a tannery near a point source.
</p>
<p>
    Sanitary inspections are usually carried out using standardized checklists
    for observations and interviews with a scoring system to quantify overall
    risk. For a complete a set of recommended checklists, see Water Safety
    Plans: Managing drinking-water quality from catchment to consumer (Davison,
    A., G. Howard et al, 2005). In most cases checklists are modified to take
    into account specific country conditions. WHO recommends sanitary
    inspections annually for all water supply systems, including point sources,
    and for every new water system.
</p>
<p>
    Sanitary inspections are traditionally carried out at different points in a
    water system, including the source, intake, distribution lines, treatment
    plant and at all point sources. Recently, the concept of sanitary
    inspections has been broadened to include not just systems and their
    immediate surroundings, but an analysis of contamination pathways, hazards
    and practices in communities and households (in some texts, this is
    referred to as “visual inspection”).
</p>
<p>
    It is now well understood that contamination of water often occurs during
    the transportation of water to the home and in the home itself. Such
    contamination is linked to hygiene awareness and practices of water bearers
    and family members and, in some cases, to the availability of appropriate
    receptacles and utensils (e.g., closed water jars and long-handled ladles).
    Observing water handling and storage practices and interviewing community
    members can yield valuable information on the actual causes of poor water
    quality and contribute to plans for interventions to improve the water
    quality status of a community.
</p>
<p>
    While training is essential, sanitary inspectors do not necessarily have to
    be water technicians. Community members with no formal technical background
    have been successfully trained in the sanitary inspection of point sources
    and small community systems. Local inspectors are often very effective as
    they are direct stakeholders in the water systems, are accountable to their
    peers and local authorities, and are in a position to carry out inspections
    on a regular basis.

<h2>
    3.2 Measuring water quality
</h2>
<p>
    The aesthetic quality of water, by definition, is determined subjectively
    by the user. The safety of drinking water for public health, on the other
    hand, must be determined analytically: water that is pleasant-tasting and
    apparently clean may still contain dangerous numbers of pathogens or high
    levels of chemicals that can cause health effects.
</p>
<p>
    Microbiological and chemical testing can be made either on-site, using
    field kits, or in laboratories. Where possible, field testing is preferred
    because it is logistically much easier, and in most cases significantly
    more cost effective. In addition, errors introduced from the preservation,
    transport and storage of samples for laboratory testing are eliminated.
    Properly trained field test kit operators can test a large number of water
    sources in a relatively short time, allowing the results to be obtained and
    shared with users within hours or days. In recent years technological
    innovations have improved the quality of field test kits, while further
    lowering costs. If this trend continues, field testing should be expected
    to become more prevalent in the future. All testing programmes – whether
    laboratory or field based – should be subject to quality assurance, as
    described in section 3.3.
</p>
<h3>
    3.2.1 Microbiological analyses
</h3>
<p>
    By far the most serious public health risk associated with drinking-water
    supplies is microbial contamination. Pathogens – bacteria, viruses and
    parasites – can cause a wide range of health problems when ingested in
    drinking water (see Chapter 2), but the primary concern is infectious
    diarrhoeal disease transmitted by the faecal-oral route.
</p>
<p>
    It is impractical to analyze water for every individual pathogen, some of
    which can cause disease at very low doses. Instead, since most
    diarrhoea-causing pathogens are faecal in origin, it is more practical to
    analyze water for <em>indicator species </em>that are also present in
    faecal matter. The most commonly used indicator species are coliform
    bacteria, which include a wide range of bacteria, all of which can ferment
    lactose and produce gas at 35°C. Many but not all coliforms are faecal in
    origin, so the presence of <strong>total coliforms </strong>in water is not
    a good indicator of poor water quality.
</p>
<p>
    Coliforms that come from faecal matter can tolerate higher temperatures
    than most environmental coliforms, so those that ferment lactose and
    produce gas at 45.5°C are called <strong>thermotolerant coliforms</strong>,
    or <strong>faecal coliforms</strong>. These are more closely associated
    with faecal pollution than total coliforms. The most specific indicator of
faecal contamination is    <strong><em>Escherichia coli </em>(<em>E. coli</em>)</strong>, which unlike
some faecal coliforms never multiplies in the aquatic environment. Either    <em>E. coli </em>or faecal coliforms are acceptable for use as indicator
    species. Faecal coliforms have a number of characteristics of a good
    indicator species: they are universally present in faecal matter in high
    numbers, are not themselves pathogenic, and are relatively easy to measure
    using simple and inexpensive equipment. One drawback of coliform indicators
    is that they are significantly more susceptible to chlorine than some other
    pathogens (e.g., <em>Cryptosporidium, </em>viruses). Also, some treatment
    processes may remove coliforms but not viruses, which are much smaller. For
    these reasons, water without <em>E. coli </em>or faecal coliforms should be
    seen as low-risk, rather than completely safe.
</p>
<p>
Other indicator organisms sometimes used include    <strong>faecal enterococci </strong>as an indicator of faecal pollution,
    and <strong>heterotrophic plate count (HPC) </strong>measurements, which
    are useful in assessing the effectiveness of treatment and distribution
    systems. <strong><em>Clostridia perfringens </em></strong>is a type of
    bacteria that can survive in the environment, and is resistant to standard
    disinfection. As such it may be a useful indicator for virus or parasites
    in water contaminated with faecal material. For detailed information about
    these and other indicator organisms refer to WHO (2006), Chapter 11.
</p>
<p>
    When assessing faecal contamination, it is recommended to measure turbidity
    along with <em>E. coli </em>(or faecal coliforms), since pathogens can
    adsorb onto suspended particles, and to some extent be shielded from
    disinfection. When water has been disinfected, it is also important to
    measure chlorine residual and pH. These four parameters (<em>E. coli</em>
    /faecal coliforms, turbidity, disinfectant residual and pH) are considered
    the minimum set of “essential parameters” required to assess
    microbiological quality of drinking water (WHO, 2006).
</p>
<p>
    Laboratory analysis is generally required for positive identification of
    specific pathogens
</p>
<p>
    (e.g., E. coli, viruses, protozoa) or non-coliform indicator species (e.g.,
    faecal streptococci). Total and faecal coliforms, on the other hand, can be
    measured in the lab or in the field using portable kits. Field kit results
    are usually reliable, can be shared with users rapidly, and the testers can
    take advantage of their visit to advocate for improved sanitation and
    hygiene as needed. In developing countries lab facilities are often
    insufficient to support large-scale testing of rural water supply systems,
    so routine field testing may be the only practical option. As a quality
    assurance measure, some field analyses should be cross-checked with
    laboratory tests.
</p>
<p>
    Since analysis involves culturing viable microbes in a hospitable nutrient
    broth, the results are very sensitive to sample type and incubation
    conditions. It is particularly important that standardized methods be used
    so that results are consistent and reliable.

    Sampling
</h6>
<p>
    Microbial analysis is fundamentally different from chemical analysis in
    that the goal is the detection of a very small number of viable microbes,
    which are not evenly distributed through the sample. Microbial
    contamination can change markedly over time, so frequent sampling is
    recommended. In piped water systems samples should cover the entire water
    system, particularly extremities where disinfectant residuals are likely to
    be lowest. However, it is easier and more practical to make multiple tests
    of disinfectant residual at different locations, in order to identify areas
    where faecal coliforms might be able to survive.
</p>
<p>
    Field workers collecting samples for laboratory analysis must be properly
    trained in the collection and handling of samples to prevent contamination.
    Samples should be stored in the dark, be kept chilled (ideally between 4°
    and 10°C), and be analyzed within 6 hours. If the water has been
    chlorinated, a quenching agent such as sodium thiosulfate should be added
    to the sample bottle at the laboratory before sample collection. When
    sampling chlorinated waters, pH and chlorine residual should also be
    measured.
</p>
<p>
    Laboratory analysis has some advantages over field testing: samples can be
    processed more rapidly, and the environment is cleaner. However,
    significant challenges are presented by preservation and transport of
    samples from field sites to laboratories. Fieldbased methods, especially
    using the membrane filtration method (see below) can produce results of a
    quality comparable to laboratory methods, as long as staff are properly
    trained in aseptic techniques. For these reasons, field analysis of
    microbiological quality is generally recommended.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<h6>
    Methods
</h6>
<p>
    The two classic methods for measuring coliform bacteria in drinking water
    are the multiple tube and membrane filtration methods. In recent years two
    alternatives, the enzyme substrate and H<sub>2</sub>S methods, have been
    gaining increasing popularity.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Multiple tube fermentation (MTF)
        <a
            href="file:///C:/Users/HP/Desktop/unicef.htm#_ftn1"
            name="_ftnref1"
            title=""
        >
            <sup><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong></sup>
        </a>
    </em>
    : multiple samples of the water being tested are added to a nutrient broth
    in sterile tubes and incubated at a particular temperature for a fixed time
    (usually 24 hours). If the water source is unprotected or contamination is
    suspected, serial dilutions of the water (usually 10, 1, and 0.1 mL) may be
    made. Three or five tubes per dilution are commonly used, though ten tubes
    may be used for greater sensitivity. As coliform bacteria grow, they
    produce acid and gas, changing the broth colour and producing bubbles,
    which are captured in a small inverted tube. By counting the number of
    tubes showing a positive result, and comparing with standard tables, a
    statistical estimate of the <em>most probable number </em>(MPN) of bacteria
    can be made, with results reported as MPN per 100 mL.
</p>
<p>
    Since some noncoliform bacteria can also ferment lactose, this first test
    is called a “presumptive” test. Bacteria from a positive tube can be
    inoculated into a medium that selects more specifically for coliforms,
    leading to “confirmed” results. Finally, the test can be “completed” by
    subjecting positive samples from the confirmed test to a number of
    additional identification steps. Each of the three steps (presumptive,
    confirmed and completed) requires 1-2 days of incubation. Typically only
    the first two steps are performed in coliform and faecal coliform analysis,
    while all three phases are done for periodic quality control or for
    positive identification of <em>E. coli</em>.
</p>
<p>
    This method is easy and requires little specialized equipment, and has the
    advantage of being applicable to turbid or highly contaminated samples.
    Disadvantages include the large number of tubes needed and the long time
    requirement for the full test. Accordingly, this test is most conveniently
    applied in a laboratory setting, though the presumptive test is sometimes
    made with field kits. Another disadvantage of this method (and other MPN
    methods) is that the result is a statistical approximation with fairly low
    precision, and as such should only be considered semi-quantitative.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Membrane filtration (MF)</em></strong>
    : A water sample (typically 100-mL) is filtered through a cellulose
    membrane with a pore size of 0.45 microns, which screens out all coliform
    bacteria. The membrane is then incubated in a growth medium at a particular
    temperature. Bacteria that are favoured by the growth medium will grow into
colonies that can be counted after 24 to 48 hours. Results are reported as    <em>colony-forming units </em>(CFU) per 100 mL. As with the MTF method,
    positive test results should be considered as presumptive, and confirmed
    with subsequent inoculations into more selective growth media.
</p>
<p>
    This is a very commonly used method in laboratories, and forms the basis of
    the most widely used field kits. One advantage is that it gives a direct
    count of bacteria, rather than the statistical estimate of MPN methods. For
    waters of low turbidity, large volumes can be filtered, increasing the
    test’s sensitivity. However, this method is inappropriate for turbid
    waters, which can clog the membrane or prevent the growth of target
    bacteria on the filter. Another concern with this method is that it may not
    detect stressed or injured coliforms.
</p>
<h5>
    Commercially available field kits*
</h5>
<p>
    A number of field kits, or portable laboratories, have been widely used for
    field microbiological analysis. All allow measurement of essential physical
    and chemical parameters (pH, turbidity, chlorine residual), and some have
    modules for colorimetric measurement of various inorganic chemicals (e.g.,
    ammonia, arsenic, fluoride, nitrate). All kits are able to run from mains
    electricity or on built-in batteries, which can be charged with solar
    panels. Some of the more commonly used kits are listed below.

    <em>Enzyme substrate methods </em>
</p>
<p>
    In recent years tests have been developed that chemically identify specific
    enzymes produced by particular pathogens. These enzymes react with specific
    substrates in the nutrient medium, and generally produce a striking colour
    change that is easy to identify. These tests are more rapid than
    conventional methods: some can produce results in 24 hours or less.
    Furthermore, they are more specific than conventional tests, so
    confirmatory tests are generally not necessary. Two of the most relevant
    enzyme tests for drinking water are described briefly below.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Beta-galactosidase:</em>
    Coliform bacteria produce the beta-galactosidase enzyme. A number of
    specific substrates have been developed which react with this enzyme to
    produce a strong colour, usually yellow or deep red. <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Beta-glucuronidase: </em>
    Over 95% of <em>E. coli </em>produce the beta-glucuronidase enzyme.
    <a
        href="file:///C:/Users/HP/Desktop/unicef.htm#_ftn3"
        name="_ftnref3"
        title=""
    >
        <sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup>
    </a>
    This enzyme reacts with the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-Dglucoside
    (MUG) to produce a chemical that glows blue upon exposure to ultraviolet
    light. Other substrates can produce a visible colour, typically blue.
</p>
<p>
    Assays using substrates that react with these two enzymes have been
    certified by the USEPA and ISO. Many commercially available assay kits test
    for both enzymes, allowing simultaneous determination of total coliforms
    and <em>E. coli</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Enzyme methods can easily be used in a qualitative way to measure the
    presence (P) or absence (A) of coliforms or <em>E. coli </em>(P/A test). A
    single sample of undiluted water is incubated for the appropriate time,
    with a positive result indicating contamination, but giving no information
    regarding the level of contamination. P/A tests are useful for screening,
    especially in settings where most samples are expected to give negative
    results (e.g., treated water).
</p>
<p>
    Enzyme methods can also be employed semi-quantitatively, using multiple
    samples and serial dilutions, to obtain a most probable number (MPN)
    estimate, as in multiple-tube fermentation. Sometimes a tray with multiple
    small wells is used instead of multiple tubes, significantly simplifying
    the procedure. The P/A test can easily be applied in the field, while the
    semi-quantitative MPN method is more readily performed in a laboratory.
    Advantages of these methods are simplicity, speed and specificity.
    Disadvantages are the relatively high cost of reagents, and the relatively
    small number of commercially available products (see box).

    Enzymatic methods typically require an incubation period of 18 to 36 hours.
    However, recent studies have shown that shorter incubation periods (&lt;12
    hours) can give good results, and if water is highly contaminated,
    coliforms can be detected rapidly, without a growth phase (Tryland et al.,
    2001).
</p>
<p>
    A number of other enzyme substrate assays exist for important water-borne
pathogens (e.g. enterococci, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>V. cholera</em>,    <em>E. coli </em>O157), though these are not as welldeveloped as the
    coliform tests, and have been for the most part applied to food or stool
    samples. Still, it is likely that they could facilitate drinking-water
    analysis in the future.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) test </em>
</p>
<p>
    In 1982 Manja et al. reported a simple method for detection of faecal
    contamination in drinking water (Manja et al., 1982). The authors noted
    that waters containing coliform bacteria also consistently contained
    organisms producing hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). H<sub>2</sub>S
    reacts rapidly with iron to form a black iron sulfide precipitate, so the
    authors developed an iron-rich growth medium. When water samples are
    incubated in the medium at 30°37°C for 12 to18 hours, production of a black
    colour indicates contamination with H<sub>2</sub>Sproducing organisms. Over
    the last 20 years a number of modifications have been made to the method
    proposed by Manja et al., in an attempt to improve its performance. The
    method has been applied as in presence/absence, most probable number, and
    membrane filter formats. Most commonly it is used qualitatively, as a
    presence/absence test with a 20 mL sample.
</p>
<p>
    The H<sub>2</sub>S test does not specifically test for standard indicator
    species such as total coliforms, faecal coliforms or <em>E. coli</em>.
    Rather, a large number of bacteria can lead to H<sub>2</sub>S production
(e.g.    <em>Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens</em>).
Most of these are faecal in origin. Both human and animal faeces contain H    <sub>2</sub>S-producing organisms, so the H<sub>2</sub>S test, like the
    total coliform test, is not specific for human faecal contamination.
</p>
<p>
    The H<sub>2</sub>S method was reviewed in a WHO report (Sobsey and
    Pfaender, 2002), which found the test to be reasonably accurate, simple and
    inexpensive – approximately one fifth the cost of standard coliform tests.
    A review of the literature indicates that the test detects faecally
    contaminated water with about the same frequency and magnitude as the
    conventional methods (MTF and MF). However, the authors caution that some
    conditions (in particular, the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria) may
    lead to false positive results. False positives are of less public health
    concern than false negatives, and the advantages of the method (speed,
    simplicity and low cost) still make the H<sub>2</sub>S test an attractive
    option. The H<sub>2</sub>S test is not mature enough to replace
    conventional methods, but can serve a valuable role in screening water
    supplies. Testing water for faecal contamination with the H<sub>2</sub>S
    method is certainly preferable to not testing at all.
</p>
<p>
    H<sub>2</sub>S kits may be purchased from a few international chemical
    companies (e.g., Hach Company’s Pathoscreen Field Kit). As the reagents are
    all commonly available in developing countries, kits may also be produced
    locally (see box in section 3.1.3). A joint research project between UNICEF
    and the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission in India has produced
    specifications for a field kit that are available from the Rural Water
    Supply Network (RWSN) at:

    3.2.2 Chemical analyses
</h3>
<p>
    Chemical parameters can be analyzed much more rapidly than microbiological
    ones, because there is no need for incubation. Analysis time generally
    ranges from a few seconds to hours. Most parameters must be analyzed in a
    laboratory, at least for quantitative results. Some parameters, though,
    might change during storage and transport (e.g., pH, alkalinity) and should
    be measured at the sampling site. Inexpensive field kits are available for
    semi-quantitative determination of many parameters, and in some cases
    sophisticated equipment can be made portable for field analysis.
</p>
<h6>
    Laboratory methods
</h6>
<p>
    A full review of laboratory methods for measuring the various parameters
    important to drinking-water quality is beyond the scope of this document.
    The reader is referred to the WHO GDWQ (WHO, 2006, Section 8.3) for a
    comprehensive listing of laboratory methods for specific chemicals that
    have guideline values. The main laboratory techniques are briefly
    summarized below, in order of increasing complexity.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Colorimetric methods: </em>
    Chemicals are added which react with the parameter of interest to form a
    product that absorbs light at a particular wavelength. Samples are then
    analyzed in a colorimeter or spectrophotometer
    <a
        href="file:///C:/Users/HP/Desktop/unicef.htm#_ftn4"
        name="_ftnref4"
        title=""
    >
        <sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup>
    </a>
    and compared to known standards. Colorimetric methods are available for
    many inorganic compounds.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Electrode methods</em>
    : Ion-selective electrodes can measure the concentration of certain ions in
    the water sample. pH is readily measured with an electrode and meter.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Chromatography</em>
    : Samples are passed through a column containing a specific packing or
    coating that selectively retains certain types of chemicals. Different
    compounds pass through the column at different speeds, depending on their
    affinity to the packing or coating. Ion exchange resin is used in ion
    chromatography (IC) for charged inorganic compounds. Volatile organic
    compounds are analyzed in gas chromatography (GC), while non-volatile
    organics are analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
    HPLC can also be used for some inorganic compounds. A suitable detector at
    the column exit allows quantification.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS)</em>
    : Most metals and metalloids can be analyzed with AAS. Samples are heated
    either in a flame (F-AAS) or electrically in a graphite furnace (GF-AAS),
    and concentration is determined by the metal atom’s absorption of light at
    a characteristic wavelength. Flame AAS is used for moderate concentrations
    (generally 0.1 – 100 mg/L) while GF-AAS is used for trace determination, on
    the order of 0.001 mg/L.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)</em>
    : Like AAS, ICP is used for analysis of metals. Samples are atomized and
    detected either through atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES) or mass
    spectroscopy (ICP-MS).
</p>
<p>
    Colorimetric and electrode methods can be implemented in basic laboratories
    with relative ease. Chromatography and atomic absorption are considerably
    more expensive and complex, and are more appropriate for central or
    reference laboratories. ICP methods are very costly and difficult, and are
    uncommon in developing countries.
</p>
<p>
    Some parameters require special procedures during collection (e.g.,
    filtration) or storage and transport (e.g., preservation with acid or a
    chelating agent to prevent precipitation of iron, which can remove metals).
    Procedures for sample collection and preservation should be documented as
    part of a quality assurance program (see 3.3).
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<h6>
    Field kits
</h6>
<p>
    Many inorganic compounds can be measured at concentrations of interest
    using field test kits. Analysis of most organic contaminants requires
    laboratory equipment. Some field test kits involve chemical reactions that
    change the colour of a paper strip, which is compared to a colour chart.
    Others change the colour of the water sample, and use a colour-disk or
    portable colorimeter to determine the concentration.
</p>
<p>
    The priority chemical contaminants of health concern in drinking water are
    arsenic, fluoride and nitrate. Unfortunately, these contaminants –
    especially arsenic and fluoride – are relatively difficult to measure at
    concentrations of health interest. Still, because of their public health
    importance, significant efforts have been applied to design robust and
    reliable field test kits for these parameters.
</p>
<p>
    Kits may be procured from international suppliers or produced domestically.
    Large international firms have excellent quality assurance programs, so kit
    quality is generally high. Domestically produced kits may suffer from
    substandard design and/or reagents, especially if the company does not have
    extensive experience in field kit production. However, domestic kits can be
    significantly less expensive, are easier to procure and can be more easily
    adapted to local needs.
</p>
<p>
    For any kind of field kit, it is of critical importance that kit operators
    receive proper training and supervision, and that field results are
    regularly validated with quality control samples and cross-checks with more
    sophisticated methods (see section 3.3).

                    sensitive test will have very few false negative results,

<p>
    Strictly speaking, sensitivity and selectivity only apply to tests where
    the results are of a YES/NO format. These terms are sometimes applied to
    quantitative or semi-quantitative results, by using a reference value to
    group quantitative results into YES/NO categories. For example, say the
    drinking-water standard for arsenic in a particular country is 50 µg/L.
    Test results indicating 51 µg/L arsenic or more could be defined as
    positive results, and results of 50 µg/L or less as negative. When this is
    done, the kit sensitivity and specificity will depend on the actual
    concentrations being tested, and will be lowest near the reference value.
    For example, if the actual value of a sample being tested was 52 µg/L and a
    test indicated 48 µg/L, the test would be counted as a false negative even
    though the measurement is actually quite accurate. If the actual value was
    500 µg/L, and the test kit indicated only 48 µg/L, this would be a serious
    false negative, and could indicate that the kit is insufficiently
    sensitive.

<p>
    Quantitative measurement of arsenic, especially at the µg/L level, is
    difficult, and no simple paper-strip or colour-disk field kits are
    available. However, as a result of the discovery of significant arsenic
    contamination of groundwater in Asia and elsewhere, a variety of field kits
    are now available. All of these rely on the Gutzeit method, which consists
    of several steps (United Nations, 2002, Chapter 2):
</p>
<p>
    1. Pre-reduction. Arsenic(V) is converted to arsenic (III) in the water
    sample. Strong reducing agents such as potassium iodide (KI) and stannous
    chloride (SnCl<sub>2</sub>) or ascorbic acid are added to the water sample.
    Reaction takes about 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>
2. Arsine generation. Arsenic (III) is further reduced to arsine gas (AsH    <sub>3</sub>), which bubbles out of the sample. In the classical test,
    liquid hydrochloric acid is added to zinc metal, producing hydrogen gas,
    which reduces arsenic to arsine. The hydrogen also acts as a carrier gas,
    transporting the arsine to a piece of paper impregnated with mercuric
    bromide. This step is problematic: hydrochloric acid is dangerous to handle
    in the field; zinc metal often contains significant amounts of arsenic as
    impurities; and the generation of arsine is slow, taking at least 30
    minutes. Arsine generation is also very sensitive to zinc grain size.
</p>
<p>
    Several modifications have been proposed to improve arsine generation.
    Hydrochloric acid can be replaced with a solid acid such as sulfamic or
    amidosulfonic acid, in powder or tablet form. An alternate to zinc is
    sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>), which is used in laboratories for
    hydride generation. When mixed with acid, sodium borohydride produces
    hydrogen gas, and reportedly reduces arsenic to arsine more rapidly than
    when zinc is used. Use of borohydride may make a pre-reduction step
    unnecessary (some of these modifications have been incorporated into the
    Arsenator kits, see box below).
</p>
<p>
    3. Sulfide removal. If the water sample contains sulfide, this will be
    transported to the mercuric bromide paper, and will react to form a black
    precipitate. This would ruin the test, so sulfide must be removed. This is
    most commonly done by passing the gas stream through material (paper or
    glass wool) impregnated with lead acetate. Some kits remove sulfide prior
    to arsine generation, by oxidation to sulfate. Sulfide removal is an
    important step, as arsenic is most commonly found in anaerobic groundwaters
    which may also contain significant amounts of sulfide.
</p>
<p>
    4. Arsine trapping. Arsine gas reacts with mercuric bromide to form a
    yellowishbrown compound. Most kits use paper impregnated with mercuric
    bromide to trap the arsine gas. As more arsine gas is trapped, the pale
    yellow colour produced becomes darker and brownish. Arsenic concentration
    is measured semiquantitatively by comparison with colour charts. Early kit
    designs inserted a long mercuric bromide paper strip into the reaction
    vessel, where the arsine gas can pass over the paper surface. A significant
    design improvement is a vessel design that forces the arsine gas to pass
    through the reagent paper. This produces a deeper colour, allowing a lower
    detection limit.
</p>
<p>
    Most commercially available field test kits typically provide colour
    reference charts, with reported detection limits on the order of 10 µg/L.
    However, evaluations have shown that results are semi-quantitative at best,
    especially at lower levels (&lt;100 µg/L) (Van Geen et al, 2005). The kits
    are most effectively used in a positive/negative format with a reference
    value of 50 µg/L, which is the drinking-water standard in many countries.
    At this level, most samples containing 50-99 µg/L are identified as
    positive, and nearly all samples containing 100 µg/L or more result in
    positive test results, though the quantitative assessment may be incorrect.
    With a reference level of 50 µg/L, there is still a significant risk of
    false negatives (~10%), but most false negatives occur in samples
    containing low levels of arsenic (10-49 µg/L), rather than the complete
    absence of arsenic. Since even 10 µg/L is not considered safe, this type of
    false negative can be tolerated. The field kits rarely give false positive
    results, though they may quantitatively overestimate actual concentrations.
    Currently available field kits cannot reliably measure arsenic at the 10
    µg/L level, so they would not be effective if this were chosen as the
    reference value. However, in recent years manufacturers have modified
    designs in an effort to lower detection limits. The newer kits are probably
    still not capable of reliably quantifying arsenic at such low levels, but
    should have lower false negative rates when used in a positive/negative
    format.
</p>
<p>
    It has been argued that field kits are inappropriate for arsenic analysis,
    because they lack the sensitivity to reliably detect arsenic at levels of
    health interest (10-50 µg/L) (Rahman et al., 2002). However, there are
    three main obstacles to the exclusive use of laboratory methods in large
    screening exercises (Kinniburgh and Kosmus, 2002): first, the lack of
    sufficient laboratories of the required quality to reliably process large
    numbers of samples; second, the lack of management experience to organize
    the collection and tracking of samples and reporting of results on a large
    scale; and finally, logistical problems associated with the transport of
    samples from the field to laboratory, and ensuring that results are in turn
    relayed back to the field.
</p>
<p>
    Evidence now shows that well-designed and implemented survey programmes
    using field test kits can be accurate. An analysis in Bangladesh of 6,341
    sample pairs from Merck kits and laboratory tests demonstrated a field kit
    sensitivity of 88 percent and specificity of 84 percent (16 false positives
    out of every 100 negative tests, and 12 false negatives out of every 100
    positives) (Rosenboom, 2004). And a 2006 study analyzing newer generation
    test kits in the USA demonstrated a high correlations to laboratory results
    (Steinmaus et al, 2006).
</p>
<p>
    At least in the short term, field kits remain the best available option for
    large-scale screening. It is critical, however, to implement QC checks on
    field kit analyses such as analysis of QC samples (blanks, known standards)
    and cross-checking a subset of results (typically 2-10%) in reference
    laboratories.
</p>
<p>
    A separate criticism of arsenic field test kits is that they expose the
    analyst to unsafe levels of the toxic arsine gas. One study found that
    nearly half of the arsine generated escaped the reaction vessel (Hussam et
    al., 1999). Newer kit designs that force arsine gas through rather than
    around reagent paper strips should greatly reduce arsine escape, but
    analysis should still always be conducted in a well-ventilated area (e.g.,
    outdoors).

    <em>Fluoride F WHO GV 1.5 mg/L </em>
</p>
<p>
    Like arsenic, fluoride is somewhat difficult to measure. Laboratories
    commonly use an ion-selective electrode, or a colorimetric procedure based
    on fluoride’s reaction with zirconium or lanthanum. The zirconium method
    uses an organic chemical (SPADNS), which forms a red complex with
    zirconium. When fluoride is present in the sample, it binds to the
    zirconium ions, resulting in a loss of red colour that can be measured with
    a colorimeter. The lanthanum method relies on a similar reaction, except
    that as fluoride reacts with lanthanum ions, a blue colour is produced,
    which is then measured colorimetrically. See Chapter 6 of the WHO Fluoride
    in Drinking-water monograph for additional discussion on analytical methods
    (Fawell et al, 2006).
</p>
<p>
    Major international companies (e.g., Hach, Merck, Chemetrics) produce
    fluoride field test kits that require a portable digital colorimeter. These
    can provide reliable, quantitative measurements of fluoride, but like the
    Arsenator are relatively expensive. However, unlike the Arsenator, portable
    digital colorimeters can be used to analyze a number of different
    chemicals, for which colorimetric methods are available. Currently there
    are no commercially available field kits that allow visual quantification
    with colour comparator charts or disks.
</p>
<p>
    A new procedure for field analysis was proposed by India’s National
    Chemical
</p>
<p>
    Laboratory in conjunction with a joint project by UNICEF and the Rajiv
    Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission. The procedure is essentially a
    modification of the proposed field kit for nitrate (see below). It is a
    novel method for measurement of fluoride and should be carefully evaluated
    before wide application in the field. If the new test kit proves to be
    reliable, it will represent a substantial advance, as it does not require
    the use of an electronic colorimeter.
</p>
<p>
    It might be possible to use an ion-selective electrode for fluoride
    measurement in the field, but most electrodes require a meter, which is not
    designed for battery operation or field use.

    Field measurement of nitrate is difficult because of the relatively complex
    procedures required, the possibility of interference from other dissolved
    ions, and the limited linear range (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 1998). Nitrate can be
    measured directly by absorption of ultraviolet light at 220 nm, but this is
    recommended for screening purposes only, and is subject to interference
    from dissolved organic matter.
</p>
<p>
    Most field (and laboratory) methods are based on the reduction of nitrate
    (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) in the
    presence of cadmium. Nitrite then reacts with a colour reagent to form a
    reddish purple colour, which can be measured visually or with a
    colorimeter. This method is subject to interference from nitrite, but this
    is not a major disadvantage since the WHO GV for nitrite is lower than that
    for nitrate. Kits are easily modified to measure nitrite alone by
    elimination of the cadmium reagent.

    Some chemical parameters (pH, residual chlorine, dissolved oxygen,
    alkalinity) should be measured in the field because they can change
    significantly during sample collection and storage. Field kits are
    available for these parameters, as well as for many metals and many other
    inorganic compounds (e.g., chloride, hardness, phosphate, sulfate), ranging
    in sophistication from simple semi-quantitative test strips to portable
    colorimeters. The choice of a method will be determined primarily by the
    required accuracy and detection limit, though simplicity of operation,
    susceptibility and cost are also important considerations.
</p>
<h2>
    3.3 Quality assurance
</h2>
<p>
    Water quality data, whether collected in the field using kits or in a
    sophisticated laboratory, must be subject to quality assurance procedures
    to ensure accuracy and reliability. Approximate or incorrect results can be
    worse than no result at all: false positive results could lead to the
    unnecessary closure of a safe water system, while false negative results
    could lead to continued use of an unsafe water source. If the public
    becomes aware that UNICEF-sponsored water analyses are of poor quality,
    confidence could be lost in the broader water and sanitation programme. For
    these reasons, quality assurance is critical when testing for
    drinking-water quality.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Quality assurance (QA) </strong>
    is a broad term referring to a management programme that specifies the
    measures required to produce defensible data of known precision and
    accuracy (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 1998). <strong>Quality control (QC) </strong>
    measures are specific technical steps that are taken in the laboratory to
    allow a quantitative assessment of the parameter being measured, along with
    the precision and accuracy of the measurement. Quality control measures are
    one important component of a quality assurance plan.
</p>
<h5>
    Precision and accuracy
</h5>
<p>
    In all experimental measurements, there is a degree of uncertainty or
    error. When reporting data, the degree of uncertainty can be measured by
    considering the <em>precision </em>and <em>accuracy </em>of the analysis.
    The precision simply means the reproducibility of the analysis: if the same
    sample is analyzed multiple times, how much will the results vary?
    Accuracy, on the other hand, refers to how close the measurement is to the
    true value.

    />
</p>
<p>
    Not precise, not accurate Accurate, not precise Precise, not accurate
    Accurate and precise
</p>
<p>
    Analytical precision can be assessed by making repeat measurements and
    calculating the ratio of the standard deviation to the average. This is
    called the coefficient of variation, and as a rule of thumb should be less
    than 10% for laboratory measurements. Precision will depend primarily upon
    the instrument and method, but also on the operator and quality control
    procedures.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Quality assurance programs involve planning, supervision, and systematic
    review of data collected and their use in decision-making. Examples of QA
    components might include the following (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 1998):
</p>
<p>
    • Establishment of a written quality assurance plan, identifying QA/QC
    activities and personnel responsible for ensuring policies are followed
</p>
<p>
    • Policies for analyst background and training requirements
</p>
<p>
    • Policies for purchasing, handling and storage of reagents
</p>
<p>
    • Policies for sample collection, preservation and handling
</p>
<p>
    • Procedures for measurement of method detection levels and data precision
    and accuracy
</p>
<p>
    • Procedures for documentation of analytical results, including a system
    for management and archiving of records and preparation of summary reports
    on a regular basis
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Examples of QC activities are:
</p>
<p>
    • Consistently following standard procedures for sample collection,
    handling and transport
</p>
<p>
    • Proper cleaning and use of glassware
</p>
<p>
    • Identifying detection limits for analytical methods and reporting results
    below the detection limit as “none detected” or “below detection limit”,
    rather than “0”.
</p>
<p>
    • Use of standard operating procedures for instruments, which describe in
    detail all routine laboratory operations (e.g., preparation of standards,
    instrument calibration, analytical methods)
</p>
<p>
    • Analysis of QC samples such as blanks, known standards and field samples
    spiked with known standards at regular, established intervals. As a rule of
    thumb, at least one QC sample should be analyzed for every ten samples
</p>
<p>
    • Periodic replicate analyses of samples
</p>
<p>
    • Periodic external validation of results by sending samples to reference
    laboratories
</p>
<p>
    UNICEF Project Officers are not expected to be experts in QA/QC procedures,
    but should be familiar with their basic components. When contracting
    laboratories for water analysis, it is recommended to request a copy of the
    laboratory’s QA plan and QC procedures for the specific analyses being
    made. If laboratories do not have such policies documented, the data that
    they generate should not be considered reliable. An informal assessment of
    a laboratory’s precision and accuracy can be made by sending QC samples
    such as blanks, known standards or replicate samples to the laboratory.
</p>
<p>
    Most QA/QC resources are designed for a laboratory setting, but quality
    assurance is even more important for field test kits. Field kits are often
    less precise and accurate than laboratory methods; conditions in the field
    are more variable and challenging; and operators may have less technical
    training and experience than laboratory technicians. Quality assurance
    begins with field kit design and procurement of materials. In too many
    cases, field kit prototypes have been developed which performed well, but
    when the manufacturer began producing large numbers of kits, lack of
    quality assurance led to use of inferior reagents and resulted in
    substandard products. Quality problems can be avoided to a large extent by
    purchasing kits from large international companies (e.g., Hach, Merck),
    which have excellent QA programmes. However, domestic production of field
    test kits has a number of advantages, including simpler procurement
    procedures and costs that are potentially much lower.
</p>
<p>
    Given a high-quality field kit, critical components of a QA plan include
    the proper training and supervision of kit operators, well-defined systems
    for data collection and analysis and the regular use of QC samples.
    Finally, it is critical to check for false positive and false negative
    results by confirming a proportion of field test kit results using
    laboratory methods.

    Preventing Contamination
</h1>
<p>
    Preventing contamination of water supplies through the protection of water
    resources is the first step in any programme to provide safe water to
    consumers. Removing contaminants from water supplies to make them safe for
    domestic use is usually a much more expensive and complex process than
    preventing contamination in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    Contamination prevention is a two-pronged process: reducing the amount of
    pollution entering the environment as a whole and erecting barriers to
    prevent any contamination that is present in the environment from reaching
    water supplies. Water should be protected at all stages in the supply
    chain: at the watershed and micro-watershed level, at system and point
    sources, during transportation and while being stored in the home.
</p>
<h5>
    UNICEF and the protection of freshwater resources
</h5>
<p>
    The 2006 UNICEF WASH Strategy Paper acknowledges the importance of
    protecting freshwater resources and outlines UNICEF responsibilities in
    this area. Below is an extract:
</p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
        Though UNICEF involvement will vary depending on factors such as water
        scarcity and pollution problems, all UNICEF WASH programmes in every
        priority country should include an element of water protection and
        conservation. Specific support will focus on community management of
        local water resources, including rainwater harvesting (for use by
        households and schools, and groundwater recharge), micro-watershed
        management and operational research...
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        UNICEF will ensure that supported approaches in improved management of
        water resources equally benefit poor and disadvantaged communities and
        households, and that interventions do not in any way deteriorate the
        quality of the water environment. UNICEF will use its position as one
        of the leading agencies in the WASH sector to bring the needs of the
        sector to the table in water resource management forums, as well as to
        catalyze and facilitate the involvement of other WASH actors in such
        forums
    </em>
    ” (UNICEF, 2006).
</p>
<p>
    This chapter covers all aspects of water protection, starting with a
    description of contamination sources and pathways. It goes on to discuss
    the ways to prevent contamination, focusing mainly on community and
    household level interventions: how to protect small systems, point sources
    and water stored in the home. Although chemical contamination is discussed
    here (and elsewhere in this handbook), the chapter emphasizes prevention of
    faecal contamination of water supplies – in most cases the single most
    serious threat to water at all stages in the supply chain.
</p>
<h2>
    4.1 Sources and pathways of contamination
</h2>
<p>
    No natural water is absolutely pure – the chemical and physical
    characteristics of water are constantly changing through interaction with
    the environment. These changes can be positive: water is purified as its
    percolates down to aquifers and some adsorbed minerals can improve the
    taste and perceived value of water. Sometimes the changes can result in
    water that remains safe, but is unacceptable to consumers for aesthetic
    reasons (taste, smell or colour). And in some cases water can become unsafe
    for human consumption through contamination by naturally occurring
    chemicals (such as arsenic) or through pollution from human activities
    (such as pesticides).
</p>
<p>
    As discussed in Chapter 2, there are two categories of contamination,
    microbiological and chemical. While the chemical contamination of water
    supplies can cause very serious problems, microbiological contamination is
    the largest public health threat, especially in developing countries and in
    poor communities. And the most serious water-borne diseases (such as
    dysentery and cholera) are caused by the ingestion of faeces, both human
    and animal.
</p>
<h3>
    4.1.1 Sources and pathways of chemical contamination
</h3>
<p>
    There are two sources of chemical contamination: naturally occurring
    chemicals and anthropogenic (caused by human activity) pollutants.
</p>
<p>
    As discussed in 2.1.1 there are nine naturally occurring chemical compounds
    that pose a threat to human health, the most serious being arsenic and
    fluoride. Other natural chemicals affect the aesthetic quality of water and
    cause health problems indirectly by forcing people to use alternative
    sources that may be less safe. Iron is the most common such contaminant.
    Groundwater sources are typically the most affected by natural chemical
    contamination although there are cases of seriously contaminated surface
    water as well. In these cases, the chemical contaminant is present in the
    rocks and soils of the aquifer and is absorbed by the groundwater through a
    variety of chemical processes.
</p>
<p>
    Natural chemical contaminants often affect large areas and multiple water
    sources, although there may be significant variation in contamination
    levels from source to source. Arsenic contamination levels, for example,
    are highly variable due to the complexity of the affected aquifers and the
    chemical processes involved. The level of contamination may also be
    influenced by the depth of the water source and whether or not it is
    capped.
</p>
<p>
    In general, natural contamination cannot be prevented. If an aquifer is
    affected, the only remedial measure is to tap another, unaffected aquifer
    (e.g., a deeper aquifer), use another source such as surface water or use
    filters or other treatment measures to remove the contaminant from the
    pumped water. In addition, there are techniques that can improve the water
    quality <em>in situ,</em> in the aquifer itself. This involves reducing the
    contamination concentration levels through dilution by injecting
    uncontaminated water into the aquifer, or by inducing a chemical state in
    the aquifer that minimizes the adsorption of the contaminant in the water.
    These techniques are in general not fully developed, and used on a limited
    basis.
</p>
<p>
    Pollutants are harmful chemicals released into the environment from
    agricultural activities, industrial processes and household wastes (see
    2.3.2 and 2.3.3). There are two types of pollution: point source (such as
    effluents from factories) and non-point source, including run-off from
    fields and emissions of chemicals into the atmosphere. All types of water
    sources can be affected by pollution. Groundwater is contaminated though
    seepage from non-point source pollutants and from point sources such as
    leaking chemical storage tanks. Surface water is often contaminated through
    the release of industrial and domestic effluents directly into lakes and
    rivers, and from pesticide run-off from fields. Even harvested rainwater is
    sometimes at risk: rain can absorb and retain contaminates from air
    pollution, especially near certain types of industries. Pollution,
    especially point source pollution, can be prevented, as it is easier to
    identify and isolate.
</p>
<h3>
    4.1.2 Pathways for faecal contamination of water sources
</h3>
<p>
    Faeces are the most serious water contaminant affecting people’s health and
    the interruption of the fecal-oral cycle is the key objective of most water
    and sanitation programmes in developing countries. Both animal and human
    faeces are health threats; however human faeces are generally the most
    dangerous (see Table 2.4). As discussed in 2.2, there are other sources of
    microbiological contamination besides faeces, but because faeces are by far
    the most common and the most dangerous, this section focuses on faecal
    contamination pathways.
</p>
<p>
    When water sources are contaminated by human and animal faeces, water-borne
    diseases can be transmitted: the many pathogens that can be present in
    faeces are ingested by humans through drinking and cooking water (and water
    is only one of the transmission pathways – see 4.2 on sanitation and
    hygiene below).

    As is the case for all water contaminants, preventing contamination and
    interrupting the transmission cycle is more efficient than purifying the
    water at the source or in the home.

<h3>
    4.1.3 Pathways for faecal contamination during transport and storage
</h3>
<p>
    Protected water sources do not ensure that water used for drinking and
    cooking in the home is safe. Household water storage – a practice common in
    developing countries – contributes to drinking-water contamination. Water
    stored in homes is often faecally contaminated at levels far above the
    contamination level at the source. Studies show that water stored in homes
    routinely have faecal coliform levels hundreds of times higher than is
    present in the source – some studies have documented thousand-fold
    increases in faecal coliforms.
</p>
<p>
    A review of literature worldwide between 1980 and 2001 (Sobsey, 2002) cited
    20 studies from Africa, Asia and the Americas that showed a deterioration
    of water quality between the source and stored water and 5 studies that
    documented increased water-related disease morbidity among family members
    in households. In all cases the problem was linked to inadequately stored
    water.
</p>
<p>
    There are three reasons water quality deteriorates during the storage and
    transport of water:
</p>

    4.2 Sanitation and hygiene promotion
</h2>
<p>
    Adequate sanitation and good hygiene knowledge and practice are more
    important for protecting water supplies than any other factor. Removing
    faeces safely from the environment eliminates the main source of water
    pollution. The proper use and maintenance of water facilities and the
    hygienic transport and storage of water protects the water supply chain
    from faecal contamination. But the importance of sanitation and hygiene
    goes far beyond protecting water quality because water is not the only
    transmission route in the faecal oral cycle (see Figure 4.1).
</p>
<p>
    Faeces can be transmitted from one person to another through direct
    contact, by exposed faeces in fields and streets, through contaminated food
    and by insect and animal vectors. Sanitation and hygiene can act as
    transmission barriers on all of these pathways.

    Improving the quality of water in sources, systems and homes can result in
    significant health benefits. However, one of the most important lessons
    learned from water supply programmes worldwide is that maximum health
    benefits are achieved if water interventions are accompanied by sanitation
    and hygiene promotion.
</p>
<p>
    This handbook provides a short introduction to the subjects of sanitation
    and hygiene. See the list of resources at the end of this chapter for
    further reference.
</p>
<h3>
    4.2.1 Sanitation
</h3>
<h6>
    The importance of sanitation
</h6>
<p>
    Sanitation is the management and disposal of solid wastes and waste water
    in and around communities and households. The most dangerous waste product
    – and thus the focus of sanitation programmes – is human faeces.
</p>
<h5>
    Faeces: the most dangerous contaminant
</h5>
<p>
    One gram of faeces can contain:
</p>
<p>
    10,000,000 viruses
</p>
<p>
    1,000,000 bacteria
</p>
<p>
    1,000 parasite cysts
</p>
<p>
    100 parasite eggs
</p>
<p>
    The safe disposal of human faeces is essential for the health of families
    and the community as a whole. But improved health is not the only benefit
    of sanitation. Privacy, convenience, reduced smells and flies and improved
    security for women (who, without latrines, often have to wait until after
    dark to defecate) are very important benefits in communities. Improved
    sanitation can be an important factor for improved education: lack of
    sanitary facilities can prevent girls from attending schools, and the
    helminth infections caused by poor sanitation can impair learning
    retention.
</p>
<h6>
    Sanitation promotion
</h6>
<p>
    Despite the benefits, sanitation coverage lags far behind water supply
    coverage. Forty percent of the world’s population – 2.4 billion people –
    still do not have access to basic sanitation facilities. The most important
    reason for this is that in many circumstances there is far less demand for
    sanitation than there is for water and other services, both among
    communities and decision makers. Successful and sustainable sanitation
    programmes begin with demand creation – at both the political and household
    level.
</p>
<p>
    The slow pace of improving sanitation coverage demonstrates that so far
    promotion efforts have been insufficient. New sanitation promotion
    initiatives rely on a variety of techniques to accelerate coverage. These
    include improved research and baseline surveys to better assess awareness
    levels and motivation of target audiences, using a wide variety of
    communication methods and media, and using social marketing approaches to
    better package and promote sanitation to communities.
</p>
<h5>
    Community-led total sanitation
</h5>
<p>
    Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) is an approach to sanitation
    promotion that encourages community self-analysis of existing defecation
    patterns and threats, and promotes local solutions to reduce and ultimately
    eliminate the practice of open defecation. CLTS initiatives do not stress
    latrine construction per se, and avoid the use of hardware subsidies.
    Instead, mobilisation efforts focus on helping communities and individuals
    understand the health risks of open defecation and use disgust and shame as
    “triggers” to promote action, which ultimately lead to the construction and
    exclusive use of locally-built low-cost household latrines. The ultimate
    goal of CLTS are communities that achieve and maintain “open
    defecation-free” status.
</p>
<p>
    The CLTS approach has been especially successful in Bangladesh. Largely as
    a result of the rapid spread of the CLTS approach in the country,
    Bangladesh is now set to exceed its MDG target for sanitation. CLTS has
    also been introduced with successful results in Cambodia, Ethiopia,
    Indonesia and other countries.
</p>
<h6>
    Design and technologies
</h6>
<p>
    There are two categories of sanitation technologies: on-site and off-site.
    On-site technologies, which include latrines and septic tanks, dispose of
    faeces at or near households. Off-site technologies like water-borne sewage
    systems transport faeces away. While off-site systems generally provide
    better protection to communities and households by removing faeces from the
    local environment, the opposite can be true when systems are poorly
    operated and maintained. And of course, removing faeces from a community
    can sometimes mean transferring the problem downstream to the next
    community.
</p>
<p>
    On-site solutions are chosen primarily because they are more economical
    than off-site systems. The most commonly used on-site systems are simple
    pit latrines, ventilated pit latrines, pour-flush latrines and septic
    tanks. As shown in Table 4.3, each has its advantages and disadvantages,
    and the reasons a household chooses one technology over another are often
    complex.

<p>
    Although many government and agency-supported sanitation programmes
    continue to subsidize the cost of family latrines at least for the poor,
    household latrines are usually paid for primarily by families themselves.
    Sanitation promotion programmes are generally more successful when families
    have a choice of technologies to buy. Sanitation programmes facilitate the
    development and production of a range of technologies (sometimes called
    “sanitation ladders”), allowing consumers to choose an option depending on
    their preferences and ability to pay and providing an avenue to upgrade
    service in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Latrine designs vary widely in response to cultural, geographic and
    socio-economic factors. Designs that work well in some countries do not
    necessarily work well elsewhere. In some countries standard designs are
    promoted nationwide while in others designs vary from region to region. In
    all cases, the two most important design criteria are safety and usability:
    latrines should safely remove faeces from the community and household
    environments and they should be attractive to all users, especially women
    and children.
</p>
<p>
    School toilets and latrines are in a special category. Sanitation
    facilities in schools not only contribute to increased enrolment and
    improved learning, but together with hygiene promotion they encourage
    children to be sanitation advocates in their communities. It is therefore
    critically important that the latrines’ design encourage their use. Privacy
    is a key consideration, especially for girls: designs must include secure
    doors and other privacy features. Studies show that separate facilities for
    girls increase their usage. Children’s size is another factor that should
    be taken into account in designs. The most successful latrine and toilet
    designs are those in which children themselves have participated in the
    design process.
</p>
<h5>
    Ecological sanitation
</h5>
<p>
    A step beyond the safe removal of faeces from households and communities is
    using faeces (and urine) as a resource. Ecological sanitation promotes
    practices and technologies that take advantage of the nutrients in human
    excreta and urine to improve agricultural production (or
    “closing-the-loop”) and to protect local environments and freshwater
    resources. Although not a new concept (human faeces have been used as
    fertilizer for thousands of years), improved promotion, technologies and
    methods have sparked increasing interest in ecological sanitation in some
    countries.
</p>
<p>
    Ecological sanitation involves the composting and/or desiccation of faeces
    which, if functioning correctly, can eliminate pathogens from faeces much
    faster than a pit latrine. The technique therefore has the potential of
    being safer than more traditional on-site methods. On the other hand,
    ecological sanitation does mean that people must to a certain degree handle
    human faeces. If done incorrectly, this can pose serious health risks.
    Other disadvantages of ecological sanitation include, in some cases, higher
    technology costs and the difficulties in overcoming cultural taboos on the
    use of faeces to fertilize food crops.
</p>
<h6>
    Sanitation and groundwater quality
</h6>
<p>
    Properly designed, constructed and maintained sanitation facilities protect
    water sources from faecal contamination. But the opposite can also be true:
    some sanitation systems are a major source of water pollution.
</p>
<p>
    Off-site systems become sources of pollution in a variety of situations.
    Many urban sewer systems release untreated sewage directly into the
    environment. And even sewage treatment plants themselves are a problem if
    they do not function regularly due to electricity shortages or other
    operational problems, or they are too small to deal with increased flows.
</p>
<h5>
    Sewage pollution is a worldwide problem
</h5>
<p>
    India: The city of New Delhi produces 3 billion litres a day of waste
    water, of which only about half is treated, and the rest is released
    untreated into the Yamuna River.
</p>
<p>
    Mozambique: During months-long power cuts in the 1980s and 1990s the city
    of Beira’s sewage pumping network was non-operational. Large volumes of
    sewage leaked from clogged pipes into groundwater, contaminating dug wells
    and increasing cholera and diarrhoea rates.
</p>
<p>
    USA: In 2003, health authorities closed beaches in California on 59
    separate occasions (for a cumulative total of over 700 days), due to
    untreated sewage releases or spills.
</p>
<p>
    On-site sanitation can also be a source of pollution. In general, properly
    sited and constructed latrines do not pose a threat to groundwater. However
    there are cases, especially in densely populated areas, where on-site
    sanitation facilities have been implicated in a deterioration in
    groundwater quality. While the use of minimum safe distances (MSD) between
    latrines and water sources can reduce the chances of contamination, more
    rigorous methods for well and latrine siting are often necessary, as
    described in 4.3.3.
</p>
<p>
    Although there is a potential for contamination to occur with all types of
    sanitation systems, the health and other benefits of sanitation far
    outweigh the disadvantages.
</p>
<h3>
    4.2.2 Hygiene
</h3>
<h6>
    The importance of hygiene
</h6>
<p>
    Improving access to safe water and sanitation facilities leads to improved
    health in families and communities. However, when people are also motivated
    to practice good hygiene practices, health benefits are significantly
    increased. Hand-washing with soap can result in major health improvements:
    one review of studies worldwide documented a 45- percent reduction in
    diarrhoeal morbidity from improved hand-washing (Curtis and Cairncross,
    2003) and another documented over 50 percent reductions in the incidence of
    both diarrhoea and pneumonia when children washed their hands with soap
    (Luby <em>et al</em>, 2005). Good hygiene practices are the most effective
    barriers in the faecal-oral cycle.
</p>
<p>
    Hygiene is especially important for the survival and development of young
    children. Good hygiene practices among mothers and other caregivers
    (especially hand-washing with soap after defecating and before preparing
    food, and the safe disposal of children’s faeces) prevent diarrhoea..
</p>
<h5>
    Disposal of children’s faeces
</h5>
<p>
    Children’s faeces are often not disposed of safely even though they are
    more likely to contain diarrhoeal pathogens than adult faeces. Children
    often do not use latrines, because there are none, they are not allowed to
    use them, or they are dark, smelly or otherwise unattractive.
</p>
<p>
    Caregivers in some countries do not dispose of toddlers’ and babies’
    excreta because traditionally these faeces have been regarded as harmless.
    The UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) carried out in 2000 in
    17 African countries found that in more than half of households surveyed in
    rural areas the faeces of children under three years old were not disposed
    of safely.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<h6>
    Promoting behavioural change
</h6>
<p>
    Education and communication are important components of a hygiene promotion
    programme. All people have a right to know about the relationship between
    water, sanitation, hygiene and the health of themselves and their families.
    However, education alone does not necessarily result in improved practices.
    Knowing about the causes of disease may help, but new hygiene practices may
    be too unfamiliar, too difficult, or take too much time, especially for
    poor people. Promoting behavioural change is a gradual process that
    involves working closely with communities, studying existing beliefs,
    defining motivation strategies, designing appropriate communication tools
    and finally encouraging practical steps towards positive practices.
    Communities should be fully engaged in the process at all stages using
    participatory processes, and special attention should be given to building
    on local knowledge and promoting existing positive traditional practices.
</p>
<p>
    Behavioural change is necessary not only at the community level, but among
    decision makers as well. All stakeholders -- from politicians and
    government officials to field workers and people themselves – must be
    encouraged to recognize the importance of hygiene.
</p>
<h5>
    Facts for Life: What every family and community has a right to know about
    hygiene
</h5>
<p>
    1. All faeces should be disposed of safely. Using a toilet or latrine is
    the best way.
</p>
<p>
    2. All family members, including children, need to wash their hands
    thoroughly with soap and water or ash and water after contact with faeces,
    before touching food and before feeding children.
</p>
<p>
    3. Washing the face with soap and water every day helps to prevent eye
    infections. In some parts of the world, eye infections can lead to
    trachoma, which can cause blindness.
</p>
<p>
    4. Only use water that is from a safe source or is purified. Water
    containers need to be kept covered to keep the water clean.
</p>
<p>
    5. Raw or leftover food can be dangerous. Raw food should be washed or
    cooked. Cooked food should be eaten without delay or thoroughly reheated.
</p>
<p>
    6. Food, utensils and food preparation surfaces should be kept clean. Food
    should be stored in covered containers.
</p>
<p>
    7. Safe disposal of all household refuse helps prevent illness.

    Hygiene and water
</h6>
<p>
    Without water there is no hygiene. Research shows that the less readily
    available water is, the less likely that good hygiene will be practised in
    households. In rural areas and some poor urban areas, the most important
    factor determining the availability of water in households is the distance
    that must be travelled to the water source. As shown in Table 4.4, hygiene
    can only be assured when water is readily available nearby.

<h5>
    The importance of well-designed and located hand-washing facilities
</h5>
<p>
    Although knowledge and motivation plus access to water are the most
    important factors influencing hand-washing practices, the existence, type,
    location and cost of handwashing facilities are also important. Designing
    hygienic low-cost hand-washing facilities is especially difficult in poor
    communities where water in the home is scarce because it is expensive (such
    as in some slum areas) or must be fetched by hand from distant sources.
</p>
<p>
    The hand-washing facilities must be hygienic (usually by providing a stream
    of water for hand-washing), use very little water, be easily made at low or
    no cost and be easily installed at or near latrines and in homes. Several
    designs including “tippy-taps”, modified soft-drink bottles, and hollowed
    out gourds have been used to meet this challenge.
</p>
<p>
    Hand-washing facilities must also be accessible to children. Taps and other
    facilities must be low enough for children to reach, easily operable,
    clean, attractive and very close to latrines and toilets. In schools,
    facilities must be robust and provide enough water to accommodate many
    users in a short period of time.
</p>
<p>
    Good hygiene practices prevent the contamination of water sources and the
    contamination of water during transport and storage. Water sources,
    especially open point sources, are easily contaminated with faeces from
    hands, buckets and other vectors. Knowledge about the dangers of polluting
    water is the first step towards eliminating contamination sources and
    blocking contamination pathways. Community managed maintenance of water
    sources and systems is effective and sustainable only if based on good
    hygiene knowledge and practices. As discussed in detail in 4.4, hygiene is
    especially important in the transport and storage of water.

<h2>
    4.3 Water source and system protection
</h2>
<h3>
    4.3.1 Watershed management
</h3>
<p>
    The protection of water sources begins with the management of the watershed
    itself, including the prevention of industrial and agricultural pollution
    that can threaten water safety.
</p>
<p>
    Water resource management at the watershed level involves the development
    and implementation of a set of national policy and legislative measures to
    ensure that freshwater resources are protected from a variety of threats,
    including not just threats to quality but to depletion through
    over-extraction. Progressive policies and laws – based on the premise that
    domestic water comes first – protect domestic water supplies from water
    competitors, such as large-scale cash crop irrigation, and from polluters.
    The process for developing and implementing such legal and policy
    instruments is complex. It involves: • detailed hydrology assessments
</p>
<p>
    • consideration of all water uses (including not just economic uses but
    uses involving the maintenance of ecosystems)
</p>
<p>
    • participation of and negotiations among key national and international
    stakeholders on water use priorities
</p>
<p>
    • the definition of quality standards for different uses
</p>
<p>
    • the definition of acceptable pollution limits
</p>
<p>
    • the creation of national institutions to implement plans and monitor
    implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Few developing countries have comprehensive water resource management
    legislation and fewer have the means to enforce them. Advocacy and
    awareness-raising on water quality and the effects on communities (see
    Chapter Six) can be an important first step encouraging the initiation of
    the process.
</p>
<p>
    Even in countries with laws protecting watersheds and domestic water
    sources, microwatershed management by communities is an important facet of
    protecting water supplies. At this level sources of pollution are usually
    more easily identified and water uses more readily inventoried. But, as is
    the case with macro-watershed management, the prioritization of water uses
    is a complex process that must involve meaningful participation by all
    water stakeholders.
</p>
<h3>
    4.3.2 Water source choice and protection
</h3>
<p>
    Minimizing contamination of a water systems begins with the choice of the
    system itself, and especially the choice of the water source. Systems and
    sources are chosen for a variety of reasons, but the relative
    susceptibility to contamination is a primary factor.
</p>
<p>
    In many countries, groundwater is the most common water source, especially
    in rural areas. Groundwater is chosen over surface water because it is
    often more widely available and less expensive to extract, and it is
    inherently safer from faecal contamination. Groundwater is not always safe,
    however. Population pressures and other factors can increase the
    possibility of faecal contamination and sources must be carefully chosen
    and protected, as discussed in detail in the next section. Groundwater
    sources are also vulnerable to chemical contamination (see 2.3). The
    wide-scale arsenic and fluoride contamination of tubewells – as well as
    other chemical contamination problems – has underlined the fact that
    groundwater is not the best option everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    Surface water is widely used throughout the world as the source for
    domestic water systems. It is often the source for larger piped water
    systems because the large volumes of water required are not available from
    groundwater sources. In almost every case, surface water must be treated
    before reaching consumers since lakes and rivers are highly susceptible to
    faecal contamination. This treatment requirement increases the cost of
    surface water, making it a less common choice for small rural and
    peri-urban systems. Surface sources are best protected through management
    of the watershed itself, as discussed above. Local protective measures to
    prevent pollution of the source in the area immediately surrounding the
    intake is also a requirement for surface systems.
</p>
<p>
    In theory, rainwater is the safest of all water sources. Although rainwater
    can become contaminated through the absorption of atmospheric pollutants,
    it is usually very pure as it hits the earth. The problem with rainwater is
    that the surfaces that are used to collect it, such as rooftops, are often
    not clean. And more seriously, the fact that rainwater must be stored for
    relatively long periods of time increases its susceptibility to
    contamination from a variety of sources. The challenges of safely
    collecting and storing rainwater are discussed in 4.4.
</p>
<p>
    The systems used for conveying water to the consumer are also susceptible
    to contamination and must be protected. Although all systems, including
    point source systems (such as a handpump installed on a tubewell), are at
    risk of contamination, piped systems present the greatest risk simply
    because there are more points on the system where contamination can occur
    (see Table 4.1). A well-designed and constructed system will minimize the
    potential for contamination. More important is how the system is operated
    and maintained. Breakdowns, intermittent service, illegal connections,
    poorly trained operators, and the lack of a regular supply of water
    treatment chemicals can all result in contaminated water.

<h5>
    Family dug wells and tubewells
</h5>
<p>
    The private family dug wells and tubewells that are common in many parts of
    the world are usually outside of any national water quality regulatory and
    monitoring framework. The sources are often poorly constructed and are
    rarely well-sealed against contamination. Exacerbating the problem is the
    fact that many household compounds, because of lack of space and knowledge,
    have family latrines and garbage pits dug close to the dug well or
    tubewell.
</p>
<p>
    There are three strategies to improve the quality of water in households
    with private sources: encouraging families to use safer community water
    sources for drinking and cooking purposes, promoting home water treatment
    and facilitating (sometimes with subsidies) improvements to better protect
    the private dug well or tubewell. All strategies have merit, depending on
    the local situation.
</p>
<p>
    In the 1990s in Zimbabwe, government and NGO-sponsored programmes assisted
    in the construction of 45,000 improved family wells, each with aprons, well
    capping and a special windlass system. Extensive microbiological testing
    showed that these wells were a significant improvement over traditional
    family wells but still more contaminated on average than community wells
    with handpumps.
</p>
<p>
    Proponents of family wells in Zimbabwe and elsewhere argue that people will
    continue to construct and use family wells because of their convenience,
    and helping to improve the wells is a valid use of public funds. The health
    and economic benefits of water close to the home are also cited.
</p>
<p>
    Until household connections to public systems become common, private wells
    and tubewells will increase in number, even in areas where coverage in
    community systems is high. In some Indian states, for example, more than
    half the population use private tubewells even though public water supply
    coverage exceeds 90 percent. An increasing number of water and sanitation
    sector professionals acknowledge the importance of household sources and
    the need to work with families to improve their quality.

    4.3.3 Interrupting faecal contamination pathways in groundwater-based
    systems
</h3>
<p>
    In rural and peri-urban regions of developing countries, groundwater-based
    systems for domestic water supply continue to be the most common. And the
    most serious threat to water quality in these systems is faecal
    contamination. It is thus important to focus in more depth on groundwater
    systems in this text.
</p>
<p>
    Contamination pathways for groundwater systems were introduced in 4.1.2. To
    understand how pathways are interrupted, it is useful to categorize them
    into two types:
</p>
<p>
    o natural or aquifer pathways: pathways that are naturally present in the
    rock in and overlying the aquifer, including cracks, fissures and the
    permeability of the material itself
</p>
<p>
    o local or system pathways: pathways created by shortcomings in the design,
    construction and maintenance of groundwater sources.
</p>
<h6>
    Natural pathways
</h6>
<p>
    There are always natural pathways in the geological environment. Where
    water is drawn from groundwater and there are sources of contamination such
    as latrines, there is always a potential route for contamination to enter
    the aquifer. Most micro-organisms become harmless – or are reduced in
    numbers – through natural processes as they travel through water, soil and
    rocks. In general, the longer they spend in the environment, the more
    harmless they become.
</p>
<p>
    Micro-organisms spend more time in the environment if the distance between
    the contamination source and the well or spring is large (both lateral
    distance and depth), if the permeability of the aquifer and the overlying
    material is low and if direct pathways (cracks, fissures) are not present
    or are long. Empirical evidence suggests that there is a significant risk
    of contamination of water sources if micro-organism travel time is less
    than 25 days (Lawrence et al., 2001).
</p>
<p>
    It is not easy to calculate or even estimate micro-organism travel times,
    and it is rarely done. In many countries, groundwater source siting is
    carried out using a handful of ruleof-thumb figures that specify minimum
    lateral distances (minimum safe distances – MSDs) to sources of
    contamination and minimum depths to water tables. These figures are useful
    in the absence of other information, but do not reflect the range of
    pathway variation within countries. And even these inadequate figures are
    loosely applied, especially in rural water supply programmes.
</p>
<p>
    Due to growing population densities and increasing use of latrines and
    other on-site sanitation facilities there is a concern in some countries
    that faecal pollution of groundwater is becoming a serious problem.
    Although in most cases it is likely that the benefits of improved
    sanitation far outweigh any potential risks to groundwater, the issue
    should be more comprehensively addressed than in the past. The old
    rule-of-thumb MSD figures for safe source siting are becoming obsolete.
</p>
<p>
    The first step in going beyond these figures is recognizing the situations
    where they may not apply, where dangers are more serious and where more
    investigation is necessary. Table 4.5 describes such situations.

                <p>
                    o population densities are high (greater than 10 people per

                    pour-flush latrines are common o high water tables (depth
                    to water table is less than 5 metres) o area is prone to
                    flooding
                </p>

                    primarily composed of medium to coarse particles (medium to
                    coarse sands, gravels, sandstones) or is fractured/fissured
                </p>
                <p>
                    o latrines and water sources are constructed very close to
                    one another (e.g., where households have their own latrines
                    and dug wells or tubewells in small plots)

    In cases where contamination is more likely, or in situations where major

<h5>
    ARGOSS - Guidelines for assessing the risk to groundwater from on-site
    sanitation
</h5>
<p>
    In 2001 the British Geological Survey published the ARGOSS manual, which
    was the result of a comprehensive programme funded by DFID to develop a
    useable methodology to assess the risk of contamination of groundwater
    supplies from on-site sanitation. The guidelines are aimed at sector
    professionals responsible for planning and managing low- cost water and
    sanitation programmes in developing countries. They provide detailed
    step-by-step procedures for assessing the risk of microbiological
    contamination of groundwater under various scenarios and use methodologies
    that do not rely on detailed hydrogeological data. The manual also provides
    information and guidance on assessing the risk of nitrate contamination and
    of carrying out monitoring programmes.
</p>
<p>
    The procedures presented in the manual, while simplified, are still too
    complex to apply in each and every situation. They are most useful in
    situations where new large-scale water programmes are being planned in
    areas with existing on-site sanitation, where new sanitation programmes are
    being planned in areas with existing groundwater supplies and when there is
    some reason to suspect that existing supplies are being contaminated (see
    Table 4.4).
</p>
<p>
The manual is available on-line at:    <u>www.bgs.ac.uk/hydrogeology/argoss/manual.html</u>
</p>
<p>
    In new water system construction projects, the characteristics of natural
    pathways in an area should be a primary determinant of the type of system
    chosen. Dug wells should not be chosen, for example, if water tables are
    very high or if the rock type is predominantly coarse sand. In practice,
    other criteria – especially cost considerations – become equally or more
    important in determining the choice of a system.
</p>
<h6>
    Local pathways
</h6>
<p>
    Minimizing contamination pathways associated with the water source itself
    (local pathways) is always important. It becomes even more important when
    there is a greater risk of contamination through natural pathways or when
    the local environment becomes more stressed with new sources of pollution
    and/or population pressures.
</p>
<p>
    Groundwater sources are protected by sealing the sources against ingress of
    contaminated surface water, and by ensuring that the immediate surroundings
    are kept clean. Properly designed, constructed and maintained sources can
    be very well protected from contamination from the local environment. Even
    dug wells, the most vulnerable of sources because of their shallow depth,
    can be made very safe. Table 4.6 lists the sanitary sealing design features
    of tubewells, dug wells and protected springs that are necessary to prevent
    contamination.

<p>
    Sanitary sealing of groundwater sources should be regulated and enforced by
    the government agency responsible for water supply. Sanitary sealing
    standards should be included in contracts and a system for supervising
    implementing agencies should be set up. This system must include provisions
    for supervising contractors during construction (because most below-ground
    sanitary sealing measures cannot be confirmed after construction has
    finished) and inspecting the finished source.
</p>
<p>
    As important as sanitary sealing is ensuring that the immediate source
    surroundings are kept clean and free of contaminants. This involves, in
    some cases, the construction of physical barriers (fences and gates) to
    prevent the entry of animals. More importantly, it involves the
    establishment of a community management system that ensures the
    surroundings are clean and the source headworks are maintained to eliminate
    local contamination pathways detailed in Table 4.1..
</p>
<p>
    All water supply programmes should include provisions for the establishment
    of local maintenance systems. These can take many forms, from the use of
    local voluntary well caretakers to professional maintenance teams paid for
    by water tariffs. The most important factor is that the maintenance system
    is chosen and managed by the community itself. The water supply programme
    should facilitate this process through awarenessraising, education and, in
    some cases, direct support such as the provision of mobile teams for
    performing major maintenance and repairs.

    4.4 Safe handling and household storage of water
</h2>
<p>
    Hundreds of millions of people do not have household water connections and
    must transport water from point sources or standpipes and store it in their
    homes. Protecting water from contamination during transport and storage is
    at least as important as protecting the source itself. There are a variety
    of pathways for faeces to enter stored water in the home, and stored water
    is often more contaminated than the source (see 4.1). Extending water
    quality protection from sources to point-of-use is an increasingly common
    strategy in water safety programmes worldwide.
</p>
<p>
    As already noted, minimizing the amount of faeces in the household
    environment through sanitation interventions and raising awareness on safe
    water handling and personal hygiene are prerequisites for improving water
    quality in homes. However, the design of storage and transport receptacles
    is also an important factor in reducing faecal coliform levels in storage
    water and in the levels of household diarrhoea and other diseases. Studies
    show clear correlations between the type of container used and both faecal
    coliform levels and diarrhoea incidence in the home (Roberts et al, 2001;
    Sobsey, 2002).
</p>
<p>
    Many types of vessels are used to store and transport water in developing
    countries, including traditional clay or metal containers, plastic and
    metal buckets, jerry cans, collapsible containers, beverage bottles and
    barrels. But to safely store water in homes containers should have narrow
    openings that can be sealed, should be made of an easily cleaned material
    and should have narrow spouts or taps to minimize contamination of water
    through hands, ladles or other vectors.
</p>
<p>
    These safety criteria are not necessarily the most important from many
    users’ point of view. Usability and user acceptance criteria are sometimes
    contradictory to safety criteria. For example, in many countries people
    prefer wide openings to make cleaning easier and thick-walled earthenware
    containers (which are not sealable) to keep water cool. Cost and
    availability are also key issues. Safe water storage containers often cost
    more than the alternatives or are simply not available in local markets.
</p>
<p>
    An important factor is that many poor families cannot afford separate
    containers for transporting and storing water and therefore water storage
    containers must also meet users’ criteria for portability – including size,
    shape and weight – and durability. As shown in Table 4.7, this will
    inevitably mean a compromise in design characteristics. Poor families also
    do not necessarily use containers exclusively for water storage and
    transport, which means that there may be even more compromises on the water
    safety criteria (an open bucket is a more useful receptacle for carrying a
    variety of material than is a plastic jerry can with a small opening).

    Rainwater harvesting tanks are a special category of home water storage
    containers. They tend to be larger, situated outside the home and they
    store water over much longer periods of time than typical home water
    storage tanks. The fact that rainwater tanks are large means that there are
    more potential contamination routes (e.g., cracks, difficult-toseal manhole
    covers) and being outside, they are often more prone to animal and insect
    vectors. Long storage times can cause quality problems including algae
    growth (if not protected from light) and mosquito larvae.

    The safe handling and storage of water, while very important, will not, of
    course, improve the quality of water from contaminated sources. And
    contaminated sources for domestic water supply are still very common in
    developing countries. In situations where sources cannot be protected, the
    treatment of water in the home (as discussed in 5.3.3) may become the only
    viable option for consumers.
</p>
<p>
    The safe handling and storage of water at the household level is receiving
    greater attention from sector professionals. This is due to a growing body
    of research indicating that both household storage and treatment is among
    the most effective of water, sanitation and health interventions (WHO,
    2007a). One forum for discussion and resources on the issue is the
    International Network to Promote Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage
    (<u>www.who.int/household_water/en</u>).
</p>
<p>
    See also section 5.3.3 for a discussion on household water treatment.
</p>
<h5>
    Water safety plans
</h5>
<p>
    The WHO guidelines for drinking-water quality include a new emphasis on the
    process of protecting drinking water over the entire water supply cycle
    from the catchment basin to individual consumers. This Water Safety Plan
    (WSP) approach makes use of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points
    (HACCP), which are used extensively in the area of food safety. This
    approach represents a shift in thinking towards the use of risk-based and
    process-oriented techniques for ensuring drinking-water quality.
</p>
<p>
    Water safety plans should be developed by water system owners and operators
    together with national or regional authorities. The plans focus attention
    on minimizing risk rather than on testing the quality of water at the point
    of delivery.
</p>
<p>
    Steps for formulating and operationalizing water safety plans, as described
    in the new water quality guidelines, are:
</p>
<p>
    o development of an understanding of the specific system and its capability
    to supply water that meets water quality targets
</p>
<p>
    o identification of potential sources of contamination, and how they can be
    controlled o validation of control measures employed to control hazards
</p>
<p>
    o implementing a system for monitoring the control measures within the
    water system and initiating timely corrective actions to ensure that safe
    water is consistently supplied
</p>
<p>
    o undertaking verification of water quality to ensure that the water safety
    plan is being implemented correctly and is achieving the performance
    required to meet relevant national water quality objectives.
</p>
<p>
    It is expected that government authorities and support agencies will
    contribute to the process by developing a set of basic “model” water safety
    plans for different types of systems that can be used and revised by system
    operators. In the case of small community water supplies, plan
    implementation will be accompanied by capacity building.
</p>
<p>
    Water safety plans are a fairly new concept, and relatively few have been
    developed to date in developing countries. However, initial experiences are
    positive (see, for example, the Kampala case study in Godfrey and Howard,
    2005c) and various initiatives are underway to promote the practical
    adoption of the report (including an AusAid, UNICEF, WHO, WSP initiative to
    pilot water safety approaches in the East Asia region).
</p>
<p>
    For more information on water safety plans, see Chapter 4 of the WHO
    Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, the Davison WHO document
    specifically on water safety planning and the WEDC water safety plan

<h1>
    Improving Water Quality
</h1>
<p>
    Ideally, a well-designed water supply point (as discussed in Chapter 4)
    will provide water that is microbiologically safe and free from chemical
    contamination by humans – although naturally occurring chemical
    contamination may still be a concern. In practice, the ideal water supply
    point is hardly ever achieved, and even well-built water supply points
    degrade over time. Furthermore, water from a clean source may easily become
    contaminated with pathogens during collection, transport and household
    storage. In an urban context, water may be of high quality leaving a
    treatment plant, but become highly contaminated with faecal bacteria before
    reaching the user’s tap, due to low pressure and leaks in distribution
    systems. In developing countries, especially in rural areas, it is nearly
    impossible to find water supplies that consistently provide water that is
    completely free of faecal contamination. In industrialized countries,
    enormous resources are invested in drinking-water treatment and delivery,
    yet chemical and microbiological contamination can still occur on occasion.
</p>
<p>
    Clearly, the first line of defence should be to use the highest-quality
    source available. Surface water can be grossly contaminated with faecal
    pathogens, especially in densely populated countries with limited
    waste-water treatment. Groundwater is of much higher microbiological
    quality, due to the filtering action of the sediments, and can provide a
    good alternative to surface water in some cases. However, groundwater can
    also be susceptible to faecal contamination from on-site sanitation
    (ARGOSS, 2001), and may contain minerals or salts that are harmful or make
    the water taste unacceptable to users. Good quality water may also be
    obtained by collecting rainwater from rooftops (see box). While
    high-quality source waters may require little or no treatment, it is still
    recommended that any water used for drinking be disinfected to ensure
    microbiological safety.
</p>
<p>
    This chapter briefly summarizes the main technologies for drinking-water
    treatment and provides the reader with references to more detailed sources.
    The approaches taken for microbiological and chemical treatment are
    different, although some technologies can be applied for either purpose.
    Implementation of treatment technologies is then discussed at the
    municipal, community and household levels.
</p>
<h5>
    Resources for rainwater harvesting and water quality
</h5>
<p>
    Rainwater collected from rooftops can be of excellent quality, though
    animal faeces may contaminate the water. This can be minimized by clearing
    trees and overhanging branches away from the rooftop, ensuring that gutters
    are cleaned regularly and designing a “first-flush” diversion system for
    rinsing the rooftop before rainwater is collected. Some chemicals (e.g.,
    zinc and possibly lead) may be leached from metal rooftops, especially if
    the rainwater is acidic, and atmospheric pollution can also be a source of
    contamination. However, serious chemical contamination of rainwater is rare
    (Pathak and Heijnen, 2006).
</p>
<p>
    A number of resources are available detailing the design and implementation
    of rainwater collection systems. See Gould (1991), IRC (1990, 2002, Chapter
    7 ), Pacey and Cullis (1986), Cullis and Pacey (1991), Gould and
    Nissen-Petersen (1999). Additional resources are available from the
International Rainwater Catchment Systems Association: (    <u>www.ircsa.org</u>) and the Indian Centre for Environment and Science
    website on rainwater harvesting ( <u>www.rainwaterharvesting.org</u>).
</p>
<p>
    There is an increasing body of work on water quality and rainwater
    harvesting. Appendix B of the WHO Water Safety Plans book (Davison and
Howard, 2005:    <u>www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsp0506/en/index.html</u>)
    presents a model rainwater harvesting water safety plan and the Bangladesh
    University of Engineering &amp; Technology (BUET) has drafted a specific
plan for Bangladesh (BUET, 2006:    <u>www.buet.ac.bd/itn/pages/outcomes/RWH_WSP_2nd_version.pdf</u>). For a
    more general discussion on water quality and rainwater harvesting see
    “Health and Hygiene Aspects of Rainwater for Drinking” (Pathak and Heijnen,
    2006:
</p>
<p>
    <u>wedc.lboro.ac.uk/conferences/pdfs/32/Pathak.pdf</u>
    ). Finally, WHO is planning on issuing a new guidance document on water
    safety and health aspects of rainwater harvesting and storage.

<h2>
    5.1 Improving microbiological quality
</h2>
<p>
    Unprotected water supplies can be heavily contaminated with faecal matter
    from humans and animals. Table 5.1 gives an idea of typical contamination
    levels and illustrates that, as expected, contamination is most severe in
    unprotected sources. It can be assumed that people who must use unprotected
    surface water or open wells are often drinking water containing more than a
    thousand faecal coliforms/100 mL. Even people using protected sources are
    probably regularly exposed to water containing from ten to several hundred
    faecal coliforms/100 mL.

    Because the infectious dose for many faecal pathogens is low (as little as
    a single virus can cause infection), treatment should be designed to remove
    the vast majority of pathogens. Treatment is generally designed with a
    particular <strong>log removal </strong>rate for particular pathogens: 90%
    removal constitutes 1 log, 99% 2 logs, and so on. Table 5.2 lists
    representative pathogens (bacteria, viruses and protozoa) that are likely
    to be present in a typical surface water source and treatment-based goals
    that would reduce the disease burden to an acceptable level

    (WHO, 2006). These values serve as examples only; casespecific targets
    should be calculated based on the actual concentration in the source water
    and a locally acceptable risk level.

<h5>
    Water quality and diarrhoea
</h5>
<p>
    Water quality is only one of the water- and sanitation-related causes of
    diarrhoea. Diarrhoea morbidity is generally linked more to poor sanitation
    conditions and hygiene practices than to water supply. However, newer
    studies that take into account household level (point-of-use) water
    treatment suggest that water quality interventions are more effective than
    previously thought in reducing diarrhoeal disease (Fewtrell et al, 2005;
    Clasen et al, 2007; WHO, 2007a). See sections 4.4 and 5.3.3 on household
    storage and treatment for further discussion.
</p>
<p>
    A 2004 meta-analysis of higher-quality research studies (Table 5.3)
    confirms that sanitation and hygiene interventions (especially hand-washing
    with soap) continue to be very important strategies for reducing diarrhoea.
    But the study also shows that water quality interventions – including
    point-of-use treatment – can reduce diarrhoea morbidity by as much as 39
    percent. Earlier meta-studies that considered only system and
    community-level water treatment estimated that water quality interventions
    accounted for only 15 per cent of diarrhoea reduction (Esrey et al, 1991).

                    water, sanitation and hygiene interventions on reducing
                    diarrhoea, most sectoral programmes (and certainly those
                    supported by UNICEF) recognize the need to have balanced
                    programmes including all effective interventions.

<p>
    Pathogens differ in their susceptibility to various treatments. For
    example,
</p>
<p>
    <em>Cryptosporidium</em>
    cysts may be retained by filters, but are resistant to chlorination; the
    opposite is true of many viruses. Furthermore, all treatment systems are
    subject to occasional failures, which may not be recognized by operators.
    The key to developing a robust and reliable system for providing safe water
    is to implement <strong>multiple barriers </strong>for pathogen control.
    Different pathogens can be removed in different stages, according to their
    particular weaknesses, resulting in water of progressively higher quality.
    The multiple barrier approach protects against the transmission of
    pathogens in the event that one barrier should fail. A typical multiple
    barrier system for treating surface water might include sedimentation, some
    type of filtration (slow sand filtration or coagulation followed by rapid
    filtration) and disinfection.
</p>
<h3>
    5.1.1 Sedimentation
</h3>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sedimentation </strong>
is the removal of suspended solids by gravity. Sedimentation, or    <strong>gravity settling</strong>, is often the first stage of surface
    water treatment, with the goal of to removing coarse suspended solids that
    might clog filters or reduce disinfection efficiency. This is especially
    needed in tropical areas where rivers often have high silt loads.
</p>
<p>
    Sedimentation most commonly takes place in horizontal-flow tanks, where
    water slowly moves from one end to the other. Preliminary sedimentation
    tanks can remove at least 50%, and up to 90% of turbidity and suspended
    solids, depending on the nature of the solids in suspension. If the tanks
    are open to the atmosphere, sunlight may promote algae growth. Preliminary
    sedimentation may be followed by a primary disinfectant dose to enhance
    colour removal, improve subsequent coagulation and to prevent the growth of
    algae and slime in treatment tanks. This also lowers pathogen loads prior
    to the main treatment phase.
</p>
<h3>
    5.1.2 Coagulation
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Coagulation </strong>
    is a process which enables small particles suspended in water to stick to
    each other, forming larger particles that can be more easily removed
    through sedimentation or filtration.
</p>
<p>
    When chemical coagulants are added to the water, they form small solid
    particles (flocs), which aggregate (flocculate) and settle out of
    suspension. Following sedimentation, the remaining suspended solids are
    removed by rapid sand filtration.
</p>
<p>
    The most common coagulants are alum and ferric salts (chloride or sulfate).
    In some cultures, plant products are used as natural coagulants. The
crushed seeds of moringa trees (<em>Moringa oleifera lam </em>and    <em>Moringa peregrina fiori</em>) are particularly effective coagulants,
    comparing favorably with alum in terms of removal of turbidity. A dosing
    rate of 200 mg crushed seeds per litre of water is suggested as optimal
    (IRC, 1982a).
</p>
<h3>
    5.1.3 Filtration
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Filtration </strong>
    is the passing of water through a porous material. Filtration can improve
    both physical and microbiological quality.
</p>
<h6>
    Rapid filtration
</h6>
<p>
    Suspended solids can be removed by filtering the water through beds of sand
    or anthracite coal. Rapid sand filtration uses filtration rates of 5 m/h to
    20 m/h, depending on the turbidity, to achieve 90% to &gt;99% reduction in
    suspended solids.
</p>
<p>
Rapid sand filtration alone can remove large pathogens (e.g.,    <em>Giardia </em>cysts, helminths) and bacteria (50%-90%), but viruses are
    small enough to pass through the filter beds. If the filter media is
    chemically modified to give the surface a positive charge, removal of
    bacteria and viruses can increase to &gt; 99%. This can be done by
    combining sand or anthracite with metal salts such as alum, iron, lime or
    manganese (Sobsey, 2002).
</p>
<p>
    More typically, rapid filtration is used following coagulation. In a
    well-operated system, this can lead to removal of 90% to 99% of bacteria
    and viruses, and over 90% of protozoa (Salvato, 1992, p. 346). Coagulation
    and filtration can also remove dissolved constituents such as phosphorus,
    metal ions and natural organic matter, under correct operating conditions.
</p>
<h6>
    Slow sand filtration
</h6>
<p>
    Slow sand filtration is an inexpensive alternate to coagulation and
    filtration, and one of the oldest technologies for surface water treatment.
    The first stage in slow sand filtration is some sort of coarse
    prefiltration (often through gravel or coconut husk) to remove large
    particles such as leaves. The pre-filter feeds into the main tank, which
    contains a thick bed of sand. The water level in the tank is always kept
    well above the sand bed, providing a driving pressure and preventing the
    filter from drying out. Water moves through the sand beds slowly (typically
    0.04 - 0.4 m/h) and passes into a storage tank, fitted with taps for users
    to draw water from.
</p>
<p>
    Slow sand filtration removes pathogens through a combination of physical,
    chemical and biological processes, the last of which is the most important.
    After the filter has been in operation for some time, a layer of microbes
develops near the top of the sand bed. In this zone, called the    <em>schmutzdecke</em>, predatory microbes attack and consume pathogens such
as viruses, bacteria and protozoal cysts (including <em>Giardia</em>, and    <em>Cryptosporidium, </em>which is resistant to chlorination<em>)</em>, and
    helminth eggs (Bellamy et al., 1985a; Cairncross and Feachem, 1993). In a
    well-operated slow sand filter, pathogen removal may exceed 99%. Still,
    slow sand filtration is typically followed by a safety disinfection with
    chlorine (IRC, 1978; IRC, 1982b).
</p>
<p>
    After some time (up to several months, depending on inlet water turbidity),
    slow sand filters can become clogged, and the flow must be restored by
scraping off the top few centimetres of sand, including the    <em>schmutzdecke. </em>After this scraping, the filter will require several
    days to “ripen” and become effective again, depending on the water quality
    and temperature. After ripening the filter can be commissioned again.

<p>
    Several overviews of slow sand filtration are available: (Huisman, 1974;
    IRC, 1982b; IRC, 2002; Raman et al., 1987).
</p>
<p>
    Slow sand filtration works best with relatively clear source waters. An
    influent turbidity of under10 NTU is recommended, though somewhat higher
    levels can be tolerated for short periods (IRC, 1982b). Surface water with
    higher turbidity and pathogen loads can be treated by using rapid sand
    filters before the slow sand filtration step. In this context, rapid sand
    filters are called pre-filters, or roughing filters, and the combined
    system is called <strong>multi-stage filtration</strong> (MSF) (IRC, 2002,
    Chapter 16).
</p>
<h6>
    Bank infiltration
</h6>
<p>
    An alternative to constructing engineered sand filters to remove suspended
    solids and pathogens from surface water is to make use of naturally
    occurring sediments in the subsurface. In bank filtration (also called
    induced recharge), a shallow well or series of wells are installed in the
    vicinity of a river or lake. When water is pumped from the well(s), the
    local groundwater flow patterns are changed, and surface water enters the
    aquifer and flows towards the well.
</p>
<p>
    In order to allow sufficient filtration and bacterial purification to take
    place, wells should be installed at least 20 m, and preferably 50 m or more
    away from the surface water source. Underground travel times should be at
    least three weeks, and preferably longer. One benefit of bank infiltration
    is that water can be abstracted from the well even during the dry season,
    when the surface water source may dry up, if the well screen is located
    below the dry season water table.
</p>
<h6>
    Cloth and membrane filtration
</h6>
<p>
    In many cultures water is filtered through cloth to improve the appearance
    of the water; this also improves the microbiological quality to some
    degree. Bacteria and viruses are small enough to pass through holes in the
    cloth, but some of these pathogens will be attached to larger particles
    that are removed by the cloth. Cloth filtration can very effectively remove
    larger pathogens such as parasites (especially helminths) and is an
    essential intervention in the eradication of guinea worm.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>
    on their own are too small to be removed through coarse filters. However,
    the bacteria tend to attach themselves onto the egg-cases and mouths of
    copepods – microscopic crustaceans a thousand times larger than the
    bacteria. Studies in Bangladesh have shown that when water is filtered
    through locally available cloth (old <em>sari </em>fabric) folded over
    several times, over 99% of <em>V. cholera </em>cells are removed. In a
    field study, cholera rates were reduced by about half in households that
    used <em>sari </em>cloth filtration. This simple (and free) treatment
    technique was easily accepted culturally (Colwell et al., 2003).
</p>
<p>
    Membrane filtration makes use of the same process, but uses synthetic
    membranes with much smaller pores, which are large enough to allow water to
    pass through but small enough to keep out particles or large molecules.
    Membranes with larger pores can be operated at low pressures, but more
    restrictive (or tight) membranes require high pressures. Nanofiltration and
    reverse osmosis are examples of tight membrane treatment methods that can
    remove viruses and even some chemical contaminants. However, these methods
    create large volumes of waste water (typically only 10%-20% of the raw
    water passes through the membrane), require a great deal of electricity,
    and are relatively expensive. As such they are not well suited for use in
    developing countries. Looser membranes (e.g., microfiltration,
    ultrafiltration) are less expensive to operate and can remove bacteria and
    parasites, if not viruses.
</p>
<h6>
    Ceramic filtration
</h6>
<p>
    Porous ceramic filters are widely used for household treatment of water,
    most commonly in the form of candle filters. Ceramic filter pore size
    varies widely, but most can reduce turbidity and parasites by at least 90%
    and substantially lower bacterial concentrations. Viruses are small enough
    to pass through most ceramics, though the surface of some ceramics can bind
    viruses. Many ceramic filters are impregnated with silver, which prevents
    bacteria from forming biofilms on the filter surface (Sobsey, 2002).
    Ceramic filters can be easily manufactured in developing countries using
inexpensive, locally available materials. The NGO, Potters for Peace (    <u>www.pottersforpeace.org</u>), has developed silver-impregnated ceramic
    water filters in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
</p>
<p>
    While ceramic filters can substantially improve water quality, they can be
    prone to failure or clogging, and require regular cleaning (Chaudhuri et
    al., 1994). A 2002-2006 comprehensive study in Cambodia sponsored by UNICEF
    (and conducted by the University of North Carolina) demonstrated that
    locally-produced ceramic filters, used regularly, can significantly improve
    household water quality (up to 99.99% less E. coli in treated versus
    untreated water) and reduce diarrhoea morbidity (households using the
    filter reported nearly half the cases of diarrhoea compared to control
    households). The study also highlighted the importance of a spare parts
    supply chain and the need for complimentary education programmes on correct
    filter use to reduce breakage and unsafe water handling practices.

<h3>
    5.1.4 Disinfection
</h3>
<p>
    The various forms of filtration discussed above can greatly reduce the
    number of pathogens present in water, but none of them is 100% effective,
    especially against viruses. And with any treatment technology, there is the
    possibility of failure, which may go undetected. Accordingly, water should
    always be disinfected after other treatment. Disinfection (physical or
    chemical) is the most effective and reliable way to ensure that any
    pathogens present in drinking water are removed to acceptable levels.
</p>
<h6>
    Physical disinfection
</h6>
<p>
    <strong>Boiling: </strong>
    Bacteria, viruses and protozoan eggs and cysts present in water can be
    killed by bringing the water to a full rolling boil. Boiling is generally
    not recommended for several reasons: it requires a large amount of fuel; it
    may give the water a flat, unpleasant taste; and there is a risk that
    people may heat the water without boiling, and consider the water purified.
    Large-scale boiling is not a feasible option for drinking water in most
    cases because fuel costs would be prohibitive.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Pasteurization:</strong>
    Unlike boiling, pasteurization (heating) cannot kill all pathogens in
    water. Instead, pasteurization aims to achieve a logarithmic reduction in
    the number of pathogens to the point where they are less likely to cause
    disease. The effectiveness of the pasteurization process is dependent on
    temperature, contact time, and heat resistance of the pathogen.
    Pasteurization is widely used in the food industry (especially for milk)
    but is not yet commonly used for water purification. However pasteurization
    has been shown to significantly improved the quality of water in projects
    in developing countries (Iijima et al, 2001; Islam and Johnston, 2006), and
    is a component of the widely used solar disinfection method (below). An
    important design consideration for any water pasteurization is ensuring
    that the system used achieves sufficiently high temperatures and retention
    times: this is achieved by setting minimum exposure times (e.g. in
    solarbased systems) or by adjusting flow rates (see box below).
</p>
<h5>
    Chulli household pasteurization system
</h5>
<p>
    A UNICEF-sponsored pilot initiative in Bangladesh has supported the
    development of a simple flow-through system that utilizes waste-heat from
    household stoves (chullis) to pasteurize water for drinking.
</p>
<p>
    The apparatus draws raw water from an elevated reservoir (with sand filter)
    through an aluminium tube coiled within the wall of the clay oven. By
    adjusting the flow rate, the effluent temperature can be maintained at 70
    degrees Celsius. Influent and effluent laboratory testing on 420 chullis in
    six pilot communities showed that the system completely inactivated
    thermotolerant coliforms.
</p>
<p>
    The chulli system can produce 90 litres of treated water per day. It is
    inexpensive (about $6), easy to fabricate and has no operation and
    maintenance costs. In the pilot area, the chullis were well accepted by
    users. Although developed as an alternative in an arsenicaffected area, the
    chulli system has the potential for wider application.
</p>
<p>
    See Household Pasteurization of Drinking-water: The Chulli Water-treatment
    System (Islam and Johnston, 2006) for additional information.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Ultraviolet radiation:</strong>
    Ultraviolet radiation can effectively kill pathogens. Electric ultraviolet
    lamps have been used to irradiate water, and several schemes have been
    developed to utilize solar energy for disinfection (see 5.3.3).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Solar Disinfection:</strong>
    The Swiss research centre, EAWAG, has shown that over 99% bacterial
    inactivation can be achieved by storing water in clear plastic bottles
    (usually used drinking-water bottles) and exposing them to at least 6 hours
of sunlight.. Bacteria, viruses, <em>Giardia </em>and    <em>Cryptosporidium </em>cysts, and parasite eggs can all be effectively
    inactivated through the combination of ultraviolet radiation and elevated
    water temperature (pasteurization). Raw water must have low turbidity
    (&lt;30 NTU), for radiation to penetrate sufficiently. This technique,
    called SODIS (Solar Disinfection) involves minimal capital and operational
    costs and is a promising household treatment option. Field tests of SODIS
    in a number of different countries have shown both significant water
    quality improvements and drops in diarrhoea morbidity (EAWAG, 2007).
</p>
<h6>
    Chemical disinfection
</h6>
<p>
    The most widely used method for ensuring pathogens in water are killed is
    to add a chemical disinfectant. The extent of disinfection is determined by
    the pathogen’s sensitivity to the particular disinfectant, disinfectant
    concentration and the length of time pathogens are exposed to the
    disinfectant. Disinfectant doses are usually designed to achieve a
    particular combination of concentration (C) and time (T), or CT.
</p>
<p>
    An ideal disinfectant would have the following properties:
</p>
<p>
    • inexpensive and widely available in rural areas of developing countries
</p>
<p>
    • easy to handle, with a long shelf life
</p>
<p>
    • highly toxic to bacteria, viruses, helminths and parasite cysts under a
    range of water conditions
</p>
<p>
    • non-toxic to humans and animals
</p>
<p>
    • does not produce any unwanted disinfection by-products
</p>
<p>
    • stable in water, to provide a residual protection against recontamination
</p>
<p>
    No single disinfectant meets all of these criteria, but chlorine compounds
    satisfy most, and are the most widely used disinfectants.
</p>
<p>
    In rural areas, the most common forms of chlorine are liquid bleach (sodium
    hypochlorite, about 1% available chlorine); bleaching powder (calcium
    hypochlorite, up to 30% available chlorine); and high-test hypochlorite
    powder (50%-70% available chlorine as calcium hypochlorite). Sodium
    dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) is also used in emergency situations, but must
    be imported. Chlorine compounds are very reactive and if improperly stored,
    available chlorine levels can be much lower than expected. The appropriate
    chlorine dose will depend on the chemical and physical composition of the
    water, and should be sufficient to satisfy both the chlorine demand and to
    produce a free residual of 0.5 mg/L. A minimum contact time of 30 minutes
    is recommended.
</p>
<h5>
    Local production of chlorine disinfectant
</h5>
<p>
    Chlorine in powdered forms (bleaching powder, high-test hypochlorite) is
    highly caustic and can be dangerous to handle. Furthermore, it can be
    difficult to make up a solution of the desired concentration, especially
    using locally available products. In general, liquid solutions are easier
    and safer to handle than concentrated powders. Commercially available
    bleach may be used, but the chlorine concentration may be inconsistent, or
    it may contain additives. Users may be reluctant to add bleach, a known
    household cleanser, to drinking water.
</p>
<p>
    An emerging alternative is to generate chlorine disinfectant locally, by
    electrolysis of an ordinary salt solution. Simple hypochlorite generators
    produce a consistent free chlorine concentration, and can be operated by
    locals without extensive technical backgrounds. The disinfectant can then
    be bottled and marketed locally for drinking-water treatment. Local
    production minimizes transport costs while creating jobs. The process is
    inexpensive: in projects implemented in Zambia, Madagascar and Kenya, a
    month’s supply of disinfectant sold for between $0.10 and $0.20 (CDC,
    2001).
</p>
<p>
    Various systems have been developed for chlorination at community and
    household levels (WHO, 1997b; WRC, 1989). Chlorine disinfection has several
    obvious advantages: it is very effective at pathogen reduction and the free
    residual provides some protection against contamination during storage or
    transportation. However, if too little or too much chlorine is added,
    serious problems can arise: in the former case, users may incorrectly
    believe that the water is pathogen-free, while in the latter, the water may
    be unpalatable because of a strong chlorine taste. Especially at community
    and household levels, it can be very difficult to ensure that the correct
    dose of chlorine is delivered. Even when the optimal dose of chlorine is
    achieved, water users unaccustomed to chlorinated water may find the taste
    unpleasant and may choose to abandon chlorination. In both industrialized
    and developing countries, experience has shown that users have chosen
    unsafe sources over safe waters with too strong a chlorine taste.
</p>
<p>
    Chlorination at any stage of treatment can produce harmful disinfection
    by-products, depending upon the dose and composition of the treated water.
    The health risks posed by these by-products are smaller than the risks
    posed by pathogens, so disinfection should not be neglected simply to avoid
    by-product formation.
</p>
<h6>
    Other disinfectants
</h6>
<p>
    Ozone is highly toxic to many pathogens (including <em>Cryptosporidium</em>
    ), but it is relatively difficult and expensive to produce and leaves no
    residual. It is not practical for household use and would be difficult to
    implement in developing countries.
</p>
<p>
    Iodine is an effective disinfectant. It is applied either in liquid form or
    impregnated on ion exchange resins. Because of its high cost compared to
    chlorine, it is generally used only for short-term treatment or in
    emergency situations. Another halogen, bromine, is a powerful disinfectant,
    but it is difficult to obtain and more costly and dangerous to handle than
    chlorine. Iodine and bromine are not recommended for standard use as
    disinfectants.
</p>
<p>
    Some dissolved metals (e.g., gold, silver, copper, mercury) can either kill
    pathogens or prevent them from growing. However, some are expensive or
    toxic to humans. Silver is the most widely used, as the required dose is
    low and it is not very toxic to humans. Silver provides a stable residual,
    and does not produce taste, odours or disinfection byproducts. However, its
    action is slower than that of chlorine and it is not very effective against
    viruses or parasite cysts. Silver is not recommended for use as a primary
    disinfectant, but can be used as a secondary barrier, for example when
    impregnated onto filter media or walls of storage vessels. It can also be
    used to prevent <em>Legionella </em>growth in distribution systems.
</p>
<h2>
    5.2 Improving chemical quality
</h2>
<p>
    Some chemical contaminants can be destroyed or converted to benign forms,
    in particular organic compounds such as pesticides or solvents. In general,
    organic compounds can be removed from water by air stripping, adsorption
    onto activated carbon, or biological or chemical transformation. However,
    partially transformed organic compounds may be as toxic as, or more toxic
    than, the parent compound. Since organic contaminants are likely to result
    from local contamination by humans, they are not considered in detail here.
</p>
<p>
    Inorganic contaminants present a different challenge, as they cannot be
    destroyed, and in most cases are not volatile. Treatment generally involves
    forming a bond between the inorganic ion and a solid surface, either a
    granular media (e.g., activated alumina, ion exchange resin) or a
    suspension that can be removed with conventional sedimentation and
    filtration. Some chemicals may become insoluble by changing the pH or
    adding an oxidant; they may then be removed by filtration. In some cases,
    biological treatment is known to catalyze the removal process.
</p>
<p>
    Tight membranes, such as those used in the reverse osmosis process, in
    principle can remove any organic or inorganic contaminant. However, because
    of the expense, tight membranes are rarely used for chemical removal,
    except for desalination of brackish or ocean water.
</p>

<h5>
    Removal of priority inorganics
</h5>
<p>
    Arsenic, fluoride and nitrate/nitrite are the primary inorganic compounds
    of health concern in drinking water.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Arsenic </em>
    presents a challenge because the treatment target is so low, on the order
    of 5 to 50 µg/L. In highly contaminated areas, these targets could require
    a reduction of &gt; 99%, which is difficult to achieve easily and
    economically with any technology. The most common treatments are
    coagulation with alum or iron salts; adsorption onto activated alumina; and
    ion exchange. Most removal processes are more effective for As<sup>V</sup>
    than As<sup>III</sup>, so pre-oxidation is usually required. Biologically
    activated reactors can improve removal of As<sup>III</sup>.
</p>
<p>
    Target concentrations for removal of <em>fluoride </em>are much higher, on
    the order of 1 mg/l, but fluoride is not extensively removed in
    conventional coagulation. Alum/lime coagulation (the Nalgonda process) is
    more effective, but requires a lot of chemical addition and produces a
    large amount of waste sludge. Adsorption onto activated alumina or bone
    char is also an option.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Nitrate </em>
    is perhaps the most difficult to remove from drinking water, because of its
    chemical inertness. In municipal plants, biological removal
    (denitrification) is possible. At the community or household level, ion
    exchange is the most practical option. <em>Nitrite </em>is generally
    removed following oxidation to nitrate.
</p>
<p>
    Nitrate is a priority inorganic because of the risk of methaemoglobinaemia
    “blue baby syndrome” to infants when contaminated water is used to prepare
    formula (see section 2.3.3). Because it is difficult to remove nitrate from
    drinking water and because the atrisk group is bottle-fed babies, the best
    mitigation for nitrate in drinking water in rural areas of developing
    countries may very well be breast-feeding promotion programmes.
</p>
<h4>
    5.2.1 Source substitution
</h4>
<p>
    Before any engineered water treatment is attempted, source substitution
    should be considered. Switching to an alternate source may be the best
    long-term solution for a safe and reliable water supply, even if initial
    costs are relatively high. Source substitution measures could include
    switching from groundwater to surface water (or vice versa); screening or
    casing wells at certain depths; rainwater harvesting; and sharing or
    blending of safe supplies. Piped distribution systems should also be
    considered, either to bring water from a safe source or to maximize the
    impact of a large treatment plant.
</p>
<p>
    Alternate water sources should be carefully chosen to ensure that the risks
    from the new source are not greater than from the old source. The relative
    risks of all available options should also be carefully assessed. For
    example, when a rigorous risk assessment based on DALYs was conducted for
    alternatives to arsenic-contaminated groundwater in Bangladesh during both
    dry and wet seasons, one alternative water source (deep tubewells tapping
    arsenic-free aquifers) had a significantly lower potential disease burden
    than the other three sources (dug wells, filtered surface water and rain
    water) (Howard and Ahmed, 2007).
</p>
<h4>
    5.2.2 Coagulation
</h4>
<p>
    Coagulation, discussed above for removal of suspended solids, also removes
    many dissolved ions, which are trapped by or bound to the charged floc
    surfaces. Coagulation can remove some heavy metals, anions (e.g., arsenate,
    chromate) and some low-solubility organic contaminants, such as chlorinated
    pesticides. Doses of coagulants (alum or ferric salts) may be higher for
    chemical treatment than for removal of suspended solids, on the order of
    2-5 mg/L Al or 4-10 mg/L as Fe. Higher doses may be required in the
    presence of competing solutes: for example, phosphate, bicarbonate and
    silicate all compete with arsenic.
</p>
<p>
    Coagulation is usually followed by sedimentation and filtration to remove
    residual solids.
</p>
<h4>
    5.2.3 Precipitation
</h4>
<p>
    Some metals become insoluble at high pH, or in the presence of high levels
    of carbonate. The most common use of precipitation is lime softening:
    calcium and magnesium, the principal components of hardness, both form
    insoluble solids. When lime is added to water, the pH rises, and magnesium
    precipitates out as magnesium hydroxide. Addition of soda ash (sodium
    carbonate) is usually required to allow formation of the insoluble calcium
    carbonate precipitate. Precipitation is followed by sedimentation and
    filtration to remove sludge. While the principal application is hardness
    removal, chemical precipitation can also remove metals (iron, manganese,
    cadmium, barium), anions (arsenic, chromium, selenium), radionuclides and
    viruses.
</p>
<p>
    Precipitation requires large amounts of chemicals (primarily lime), and
    produces large volumes of waste sludge. Following softening, water pH is
    generally above 10, and must be lowered prior to distribution or
    consumption. This is most commonly achieved by addition of carbon dioxide.
</p>

<h5>
    The Nalgonda process
</h5>
<p>
    The Nalgonda process, developed in India, makes use of coagulation and
    precipitation to remove fluoride from water. Alum and lime are added to
    form polymeric aluminium hydroxide species at high pH. Fluoride reacts with
    these aluminium species, and is

                    removed along with aluminium flocs that settle out of
                    solution. Calcium fluoride precipitates may also form. If
                    the raw water is very hard, or low in alkalinity, more lime
                    must be added to allow efficient floc formation.

<h4>
    5.2.4 Oxidation
</h4>
<p>
    Strong oxidants can help to break down organic chemicals, and can in some
    cases convert inorganic chemicals to a form that is easier to remove.
    Atmospheric oxygen is the most widely available oxidant, but it is weaker
    than other chemical oxidants such as free chlorine, permanganate and ozone.
</p>
<p>
    The use of groundwater for drinking water is in many cases limited by the
    presence of dissolved iron and, to a lesser extent, manganese. These give
    the water an unpleasant metallic taste and stain food, sanitary ware and
    laundry. Both metals can be oxidized to form an insoluble precipitate,
    which can then be removed by filtration. Oxygen can in some cases be used
    for the oxidation of dissolved iron, but oxidation is slow below pH 7, or
    if the iron is bound with organic matter. Sometimes the water pH is
    increased by using alkaline filter media, such as limestone. Chemical
    oxidants are generally required to oxidize dissolved manganese or to
    achieve more rapid oxidation of iron: potassium permanganate is used most
    commonly.
</p>
<p>
    Much effort has been spent on developing simple methods to remove iron and
    manganese from water. Most are based on oxidation followed by filtration,
    though biological processes probably contribute significantly to removal
    efficiency. While small community-based plants often work well initially,
    long-term success is less common, due to inadequate maintenance. Examples
    of community-level iron and manganese removal plants are provided by
    Hartmann (2001) and Cairncross and Feachem (1993). The inexpensive
    well-head iron removal filters developed by Finnida and UNICEF in 1989 in
    Sri Lanka are an example of a successful application of this technology.
    Iron removal filters have also been extensively used in India.
    Specifications for an iron removal plant based on a design tested in Uganda
    are available from the Cranfield University Institute of Water and
    Environment, at <u>www.silsoe.cranfield.ac.uk/iwe/iron.htm</u>.

<h4>
    5.2.5 Adsorption
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Adsorption </strong>
    is the formation of bonds between dissolved species or small particles and
    the surface of a solid. Usually the solid is in the form of granular media,
    and water is treated by passage through packed beds. Powdered adsorbents
    may also be used, and adsorption is a key process during coagulation. Ion
    exchange can be considered as a special form of adsorption, though it is
    often considered separately.
</p>
<p>
    The efficiency of adsorption depends primarily on the attraction of the
    contaminant for the media being used and the extent of contact between
    water and surfaces (controlled by particle size and loading rates). Water
    chemistry may also be important: positively charged species (like most
    metals) are more easily removed at high pH, while negatively charged
    species (like arsenate) are best removed at lower pH. Competition from
    other dissolved species or clogging of the media by particles can also
    greatly reduce adsorption of the target chemical. All adsorption media have
    a limited number of sites where adsorption occurs, and as these sites are
    filled the media becomes exhausted and must be replaced or regenerated.
</p>
<p>
    Water treatment with granular adsorption media is relatively easy to
    implement: water is simply passed through packed beds containing the media.
    Adsorption may be improved by pre-treatment such as pH adjustment,
    oxidation or turbidity removal. One drawback of adsorption treatment
    systems is that it is not easy to tell when media have become exhausted.
</p>
<h6>
    Activated carbon/charcoal
</h6>
<p>
    Black carbon can remove many organic contaminants, including natural
    organic compounds that cause taste and odour problems. Wood charcoal is a
    convenient source of black carbon in developing countries. Activated carbon
    is chemically very similar to charcoal, but with a much greater surface
    area. Most toxic synthetic organic chemicals (pesticides, solvents) will be
    adsorbed by carbon. Fresh activated carbon can adsorb microbes, including
    pathogens, from water, but these tend to form biofilms on the carbon
    surface, reducing its capacity. Activated carbon also removes chlorine
    residuals, so biofilms can grow even when disinfectants are applied.
    Activated carbon is sometimes impregnated with silver to prevent biofilm
    formation. However, biofilms can improve removal of some organic compounds,
    by biological oxidation.
</p>
<p>
    Carbon does not remove most inorganic contaminants. However, the
    carbon-based adsorbent <strong>bone char </strong>is known to remove a
    number of heavy metals and has a high adsorption capacity for fluoride.
</p>
<h6>
    Activated alumina
</h6>
<p>
    Like activated carbon, activated alumina has a very high surface area,
    giving it a relatively high adsorption capacity. The alumina surface has a
    strong attraction for many inorganic anions, and is commonly used for the
    removal of arsenic and fluoride. Activated alumina can also be used to
    remove other anions, including silica, selenium, uranium (as uranyl
    carbonate) and natural organic matter from water. Surprisingly, arsenite is
    also removed, even though it is neutrally charged below pH 9.2. Of course,
    the presence of competing anions, especially natural organic matter and
    sulfate, will reduce the adsorption capacity for the target anion.
</p>
<p>
    Adsorption onto activated alumina is sensitive to pH, and is optimal in the
    5.0-6.0 range. Above pH 8 activated alumina is ineffective. Ideally water
    would be acidified prior to treatment, but significant removal is still
    likely with untreated water, if the pH is near neutral.
</p>
<p>
    Exhausted media may be regenerated with strong alkali, followed by strong
    acid to reestablish a positive surface charge. However, regeneration is
    inefficient, and adsorption capacity deteriorates with each regeneration
    cycle. Regeneration produces strong alkali and acid wastes and potentially
    high arsenic or fluoride levels.
</p>
<p>
    In spite of the drawbacks of activated alumina it remains a viable
    technology for the removal of arsenic and fluoride, especially in community
    or household systems. Granular media are inherently easier to work with
    than chemical methods, since operation and maintenance is easier. In the
    case of fluoride, there are few competing technologies: the fluoride ion is
    much more strongly attracted to the alumina surface than to synthetic anion
    exchange resins, and activated alumina is simpler to implement than
    coagulation/precipitation methods (see boxes, “The Nalgonda process” and
    “Fluoride removal in India”). And since arsenic occurs at much lower
    levels, the media can be used for a long time before regeneration or
    replacement. The ability to remove As<sup>III</sup> without a pre-oxidation
    step is also a significant advantage.
</p>
<h6>
    Other adsorbent media
</h6>
<p>
    Many inorganic chemicals bind to the surface of iron oxides, much as they
    do to activated alumina or during coagulation with iron salts. Iron-based
    media are beginning to become commercially available in granular form
    (e.g., granular ferric hydroxide). These reportedly have a high affinity
    for heavy metals and arsenic, and have a wider effective pH range than
    activated alumina. At present, these are only available from a few
    producers. Low-cost iron-based media can be made locally by coating sand or
    other materials with iron oxide.
</p>
<p>
    Metallic iron also is increasingly used in drinking-water treatment and
    undergoes a complex series of reactions that are not yet well understood.
    Still, metallic iron shows great promise in the treatment of many organic
    compounds, as well as inorganic compounds such as arsenic.
</p>
<h4>
    5.2.6 Ion exchange
</h4>
<p>
    Ion exchange<strong> </strong>is very similar to adsorption, in that it
    involves passing water through beds of granular media which remove the
    target contaminant. The difference is that ion exchange media is made of
    synthetic resins, which forms easily reversible bonds with ions. This
    allows much better regeneration than, for example, activated alumina, and
    ion exchange resins can be reused many times. Salt solutions (brines) are
    used for regeneration.
</p>
<p>
    The most common application of ion exchange resins is for removal of
    cations (positively charged ions) that cause hardness, chiefly calcium and
    magnesium. Cation exchange resins can also remove barium and radium. Other
    resins target anions (negatively charged ions) and are used to remove
    nitrate, arsenate, chromate, selenium and uranium. Molybdenum and boron may
    also be removed to some extent. Anion exchange is the most readily
    available technology for nitrate removal.
</p>
<p>
    Ion exchange resin should not be used in waters with high salinity or
    sulfate, because competing ions will quickly exhaust the media. Also, iron
    removal may be necessary to prevent fouling of the media with oxide
    precipitates.
</p>
<h4>
    5.2.7 Membrane filtration
</h4>
<p>
    Synthetic membranes with small pores can remove large molecules while
    allowing water to pass through. Reverse osmosis, the main technology used
    for desalination, can effectively remove most inorganic contaminants but
    requires a lot of electricity to create the pressure needed to drive water
    through. Nanofiltration, which uses membranes with slightly larger pores,
    can also remove many ions from water, including arsenic. Electrodialysis is
    a related removal process that uses an electrical potential rather than
    water pressure to drive ions through membranes with relatively large pores.
</p>
<p>
    Membranes can easily be fouled by organic matter or iron, so water usually
    is pretreated. Because of the complexity of operation and high cost,
    membrane processes are not generally appropriate for use in developing
    countries.
</p>
<h4>
    5.2.8 Biological removal processes
</h4>
<p>
    Microbes, especially bacteria, can play an important role in catalyzing
    many of the above processes, which may go unrecognized. Iron removal
    plants, for example, are often designed for treatment by physical and
    chemical processes. But iron-oxidizing bacteria, which are found everywhere
    in the environment, typically colonize the filtration media, and may end up
    being responsible for the majority of iron removal.
</p>
<p>
    Other treatment systems are explicitly designed to use biological
    processes. Many organic contaminants can be broken down by bacteria, given
    the right conditions. Bacterial denitrification is the principal technology
    for nitrate removal in large municipal treatment plants.
</p>
<h4>
    5.2.9 Management of residuals
</h4>
<p>
    All treatment technologies will result in some kind of waste product, which
    should be handled and disposed of safely. Many wastes are harmless and can
    simply be disposed of locally. Some residuals, though, may contain elevated
    levels of chemicals that require special management.
</p>
<p>
    Residual management is more of an issue in municipal or community-level
    treatment systems: household treatment generates small waste streams, which
    in most cases can be disposed of locally. Small amounts of waste can be
    safely disposed in sanitary latrines, where they will not recontaminate
    drinking-water supplies. If household waste is very toxic (e.g.,
    concentrated arsenic waste accumulated over months) it may be collected for
    central treatment or landfill disposal.
</p>
<p>
    Potentially hazardous wastes might leach toxic chemicals into the
    environment after disposal. The stability of a waste can be evaluated using
    chemical tests such as the USEPA’s Toxicity Characteristic Leaching
    Procedure (TCLP) test (USEPA, 2002, Chapter 8). If testing shows that the
    waste is likely to leach, it may be stabilized by mixing with cement or
    blending with glass.
</p>
<h2>
    5.3 Water quality interventions
</h2>
<p>
    Even when there are established technologies for reducing a given
    contaminant, implementation of water treatment schemes is a major
    challenge. Different approaches are appropriate in different contexts. One
    useful categorization of interventions is by the level of centralization:
    municipal, community-based or household-based.
</p>
<h4>
    5.3.1 Municipal (centralized) treatment
</h4>
<p>
    Cities and large towns may have substantial infrastructure for treatment
    and delivery of drinking water. These are conventionally operated by
    government employees, though privatization of water supply is a growing
    trend (see Lobina and Hall, 2000; Palmer et al., 2003; Rivera, 1997; Sansom
    et al., 2003). Wagner and Pinheiro (2001) offer a useful resource for
    optimizing and upgrading municipal treatment plants.
</p>
<p>
    Municipal treatment allows relatively complex technologies to be applied by
    operators with technical backgrounds in engineering and chemistry. Water
    quality can be monitored at various points during treatment, and conditions
    can be optimized as needed by adjusting process parameters. In many
    developing countries, however, treatment is less of a problem than
    delivery. Distribution networks may be poorly constructed and sporadically
    maintained, and unauthorized connections are commonplace. Public water
    supply points and mains are frequently damaged. Typically, at least 30% and
    as much as 60% of water produced can be lost during distribution
    (Cairncross and Feachem, 1993). Distribution loss is not only inefficient
    and economically unsustainable, but leads to low pressure and infiltration
    of surface water heavily polluted with faecal material (Farley, 2001).
    Thus, it would be a mistake to spend a lot of money on producing
    top-quality water, for example using reverse osmosis, only to have it be
    contaminated during distribution (e.g., Semenza et al., 1998). The World
    Plumbing Council/WHO publication Health Aspects of Plumbing (2006) provides
    a comprehensive and useful guide for ensuring water safety in both
    production and distribution systems in developing countries.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<h4>
    5.3.2 Community-level treatment
</h4>
<p>
    While municipal water treatment and piped water are available in most urban
    settings, in small towns, peri-urban and rural areas, people must usually
    collect water on their own, either from community-managed or private
    sources. Some community-managed systems include piped distribution systems
    and even in-home taps.
</p>
<p>
    The fundamental difference between municipal and community water supply is
    in the management structure. Municipal supplies are managed and run by
    government employees (or private sector contractors), with little input
    from beneficiaries. Community supplies designed along this model tend to
    fail, because systems are not maintained and operated in a professional
    manner. Community level treatment systems are more likely to work when
    community members are involved in the selection, design, construction, and
    operation and maintenance of water supply systems. Beneficiaries should
    contribute some or all of the start-up and operating and maintenance costs
    of any treatment project.
</p>
<p>
    The design of sustainable mechanisms for community participation and
    management is critical, but beyond the scope of this document. See the
    UNICEF Water Handbook (UNICEF, 1999) for more in-depth discussion. Other
    useful references are IRC (2002), Appelton and Evans (1993), van
    Wijk-Sijbesma (1995, 1998), Bolt and Fonseca (2001), Brikké (2000) and WHO
    (1996).
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, it would be possible to identify a source of water that would
    require little or no treatment after construction. Water treatment at the
    community level should only be considered if no sufficiently pure water
    sources are available, and if community members want the new source and are
    willing and able to contribute to its construction, operation and
    maintenance.
</p>
<p>
    If treatment is required, simple technologies are preferable. Chemical
    addition, apart from chlorination, should be avoided if possible. Slow sand
    filtration can be implemented successfully and is preferable to coagulation
    and filtration. Likewise, chemical treatment using adsorption (or ion
    exchange) in filter beds is more easily applied than coagulation or
    precipitation methods.
</p>
<p>
    Disinfection is recommended after any treatment process. Liquid
    hypochlorite solutions are easily applied at the community level and many
    designs are available for automatic delivery of chlorine (Cairncross and
    Feachem, 1993). However, it is difficult to ensure a constant disinfection
    rate with on-site disinfection. Too much chlorine and the water will be
    undrinkable, too little chlorine and users will have a false sense of
    security. Household disinfection, discussed below, may be more effective.
</p>
<h4>
    5.3.3 Household level treatment
</h4>
<p>
    Properly protected water resources and water sources (Chapter 4) and
    well-managed municipal and community treatment systems should result in
    safe water for consumers. In reality, this is often hard to achieve,
    especially in rural and poor urban areas in developing countries. Leaky and
    sporadically functioning distribution systems allow recontamination to
    occur, as do poor hygiene, water transport and storage practices. Another
    reason water is unsafe is that in many countries safe water is simply not
    available and people rely on unimproved, contaminated water sources. In
    some cases, the only alternative is to treat water in the home.
</p>
<p>
    Home treatment (also known as household treatment or point-of-use
    treatment) is an option increasingly adopted by householders themselves. In
    urban settings (both in developing and industrialized countries) it is now
    common for middle class and richer households to boil, filter or use
    ultraviolet disinfection systems to treat real or perceived threats to the
    quality of water in piped systems. In rural settings some form of treatment
    – usually filtration – is also common in some areas.
</p>
<p>
    There is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating that home water
    treatment (coupled with improved storage and handling) significantly
    improves microbial water quality and has a greater impact on diarrhoea
    morbidity than previously thought (Fewtrell et al, 2005; Clasen et al,
    2007). Because home water treatment can also be very cost effective and
    rapidly deployed, it is now thought to be amongst the most effective of
    water, sanitation and health interventions (WHO, 2007a). In recognition of
    this, the new UNICEF WASH strategy paper highlights the need for UNICEF
    country programmes to promote improved water safety at the household level
    including the development of point-of-use water treatment systems.
</p>
<p>
    Although people have been using home-based treatment for years, governments
    and support agencies have in the past focused on community and
    municipal-based solutions for both water production and treatment. But this
    is now changing. Decision-makers and sector professionals are increasingly
    acknowledging that home treatment is a viable alternative to
    community-based solutions, especially in areas where water coverage is low
    or where even improved water sources are contaminated (e.g., in India, a
    country with water coverage rates above 90%, a recent study estimated that
    22 % of public water sources – most of which are deep tubewells – are
    faecally contaminated). Home treatment is also a viable alternative in
    areas with chronic emergencies or instability.
</p>
<p>
    Home-based treatment can be a more sustainable solution than communal
    systems because people are more motivated to correctly operate and maintain
    their own systems than they are communal ones. Also contributing to the
    movement towards home-based treatment is the availability of new low-cost
    treatment technologies specifically designed for poor households in rural
    or peri-urban areas (as discussed below).
</p>
<p>
    But home water treatment is not about technology alone. To reliably improve
    water quality, the technologies and techniques must be used correctly and
    consistently. This means that users must be motivated, skilled and have the
    resources to purchase products and consumables throughout the year. It also
    means that large-scale programmes are successful only when technologies are
    affordable and a strong emphasis is placed on marketing. Most importantly,
    home water treatment on its own cannot significantly and sustainably reduce
    the incidence of water-related diseases unless water is stored and used
    safely and all household members practice good hygiene (see Chapter 4 for
    discussions on hygiene and water storage).
</p>
<h6>
    Microbiological treatment methods
</h6>
<p>
    Many of the methods described in 5.1 are applicable in the home setting.
    This discussion focuses on a selection of low-cost technologies that are
    widely promoted in rural and peri-urban areas, and their applicability for
    poor households. See section 5.1 for additional details.
</p>
<p>
    At the household level, simple sedimentation can significantly reduce
    turbidity, though clay particles may be too fine to settle. Large pathogens
    such as protozoa may also settle if stored overnight or longer. Bacteria
    and viruses are too small to settle by gravity, but these pathogens may be
    attached to suspended solids which do settle. In the absence of light and a
    food source, pathogens will slowly die off during storage. However,
    household storage can also lead to greater contamination if faecal
    contamination is high and water is kept in inappropriate container.

<h5>
    Additional resources on household water treatment
</h5>
<p>
    In order to promote increased use of household-based water treatment
    methods, WHO has established the International Network to Promote Household
    Water Treatment and Safe Storage, which includes over 100 participant
    organizations including UNICEF. (<u>www.who.int/household_water/en/</u> ).
</p>
<p>
    One output from this network (available on the above website) is the
detailed report describing home treatment and storage of water,    <em>Managing water in the home: </em>

<p>
    <em>accelerated health gains from improved water supply</em>
    (Sobsey, 2002). See this report, and sections 5.1 and 5.2 for additional
    information on household-based treatment systems.

water treatment, with an emphasis on chlorination (    <u>http://www.cdc.gov/safewater/</u> ).

</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Boiling: </strong>
    While boiling water is highly effective at removing pathogens, due to
    rising fuel costs (and disappearing forests) this is increasingly out of
    reach for most people.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Natural solar disinfection (SODIS):</strong>
    When small transparent bottles of water are left out in the sun for a
    period of time, the combined effect of ultraviolet radiation (UV-A) and
    heat (pasteurization) inactivates most pathogens, making the water safe to
    drink. SODIS is growing in popularity because it is ultra-low cost or free
    (using discarded plastic bottles) and relatively simple to implement.
    However, because at least 6 hours of exposure to bright sunlight is
    required to de-activate pathogens, SODIS is not applicable in some climates
    and during rainy seasons. The technique also requires low-turbidity water
    to be effective. In some areas user acceptance has been low, due to the
    time it takes to disinfect water and the fact that drinking water is hot
    unless the bottles are left aside to cool.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Pasteurization:</strong>
    Pasteurization (heating to temperatures in excess of 70 degrees Celsius) of
    water on its own (without UV filtration) can also sufficiently reduce the
    number of active pathogens to make water safe for drinking. While not yet
    in wide use, a technique from Bangladesh that makes use of waste heat from
    cooking stoves is showing promise (see the Chulli Household Pasteurization
    box in section 5.1.4).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Electric UV disinfection:</strong>
    Using an electric system to produce ultraviolet radiation to disinfect
    water is much faster than relying on the sun. Many household units are
    available on the marketplace, but are generally too costly for poor
    families to purchase and operate. However, the popularity of these units
    (which are widely used in richer urban homes in some countries) is
    resulting in lower costs and, as electricity becomes more available, they
    may become a viable alternative for poor people. In addition, work is
    ongoing to develop less expensive units that use less power (and can be
    powered by photoelectric cells) and may be appropriate for use in rural
    areas.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Chlorination: </strong>
    Chlorine, used correctly with low- turbidity water, is a very effective
    disinfectant<strong>. </strong>Unlike the above technologies, chlorine
    disinfection has a residual effect – it continues to protect against the
    re-contamination of water over a period of time. This is the primary
    advantage of chlorine and the reason it is used widely in municipal
    systems. Chlorination also has disadvantages: chlorine products can be
    expensive (even bleaching powder can be too expensive for many households),
    difficult to market and can have a short shelf life. However new approaches
    to home chlorination programming are overcoming these problems, and have
    been shown to be successful at reducing diarrhoea rates (Quick et al, 2002;
    Lule et al, 2005).
</p>
<p>
    The CDC Safe Water System (<u>www.cdc.gov/safewater/</u> ) promotes local
    chlorine (sodium hypochlorite) production using salt and a targeted
    community education and mobilization programme, along with promotion of
    improved containers for household storage (CDC, 2001) (see also the Local
    Production of Chlorine Disinfectant box in section 5.1.4). CDC, the social
    marketing NGO PSI, UNICEF, WHO and other organizations support programmes
    that market ready-made sodium hypochlorite solutions in a growing number of
    developing countries. Continuous extensive marketing of the product is the
    key to the success of these programmes, and in some countries high
    awareness and usage rates have been achieved (Olembo et al, 2004; Stockman
    et al, 2007).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Coagulation and precipitation</strong>
    : In-home methods have been used in some regions for many years, especially
    with alum and vegetation extracts. While some studies have shown that good
    results can be obtained, the method can be difficult to use widely and
    consistently since it is dependent on a variety of variables, including the
    chemical characteristics of the water, correct dosages and careful mixing.
    Unlike the above methods, this method can be effective with turbid water.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Combined coagulation, precipitation and chlorination</strong>
    : Products that combine coagulation and chlorination chemicals in a single
    packet have been successfully tested in households in developing countries
    and used widely in emergency situations (see discussion of emergency
    purification in 5.3). This method can effectively treat poor quality turbid
    water and provide residual disinfection. It also uses significantly less
    chlorine than chlorination alone (because it reduces turbidity), which
    reduces costs. If costs can be further reduced through local manufacturing,
    it may become a viable alternative for poorer households.
</p>
<h5>
    Household chlorination in Guatemala: conventional chlorination vs. combined
    coagulation/chlorination techniques
</h5>
<p>
    In 2000 a study conducted in Guatemala (Rangel et al., 2003) examined the
    impact of household chlorination on drinking-water quality. The
    effectiveness of a commercially formulated combined product (Procter and
    Gamble’s PuR, which incorporates precipitation, coagulation, flocculation
    and chlorination) was compared to conventional chlorination with locally
    available bleach. Water stored using conventional clay jars was used as a
    control. The combined product was able to produce water with no detectable
    faecal coliforms, when used with an improved storage vessel. When used with
    the conventional clay storage jars, good removal was found in most cases,
    but some units contained several hundred faecal coliforms per 100 mL
    sample.
</p>
<p>
    In a follow-up randomized control trial study amongst the same population
    that focused on diarrhoea morbidity rates (Reller et al, 2003), the
    combined product reduced incidence by 24 percent over the control
    population (29 percent in households that also received an improved storage
    vessel). However, households that received bleach alone achieved similar
    diarrhoea reduction levels (25 percent).
</p>
<p>
    Since 2003, the PuR sachets (and similar products from other companies –
    see box in section 5.3.4) are in wider use, including in emergency
    situations. In 2005, UNICEF entered into a global partnership with Proctor
    and Gamble to promote water safety in UNICEF programmes worldwide,
    including through the use of the PuR sachets and other technologies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Filtration: </strong>
    Many home water filters are available in the marketplace, and are used
    widely in some countries. However the filters most effective at removing
    pathogens (factory manufactured ceramic filters, some membrane filters and
    granular media filters) are often too costly to purchase and operate for
    poorer households. But there are exceptions. For example, some low-cost
    artisan-produced ceramic filters have proven to be effective (see section
    5.1.3), but quality can vary widely. Effective bucket-type granular filters
    can be produced locally at low cost, but the maintenance requirements are
    fairly high and media must be replaced on a regular basis. Slow sand
    filters can be effective and inexpensive, but the operation and maintenance
    skills required to keep them functioning well make them difficult to
    implement at the household level.
</p>
<p>
    Some successes have been reported with the BioSand filter, marketed by the
    Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology (<u>www.cawst.org</u>
    and <u>www.jalmandir.com</u>) and used in several countries, however the
    filters usually achieve only 90 percent virus inactivation in the field
    (Lantagne, 2006 and <u>www.jalmandir.com</u>).
</p>
<p>
    Filters that are not effective at removing all pathogens can still be
    useful in special situations. For example, inexpensive filters are used in
    guinea worm endemic areas to remove copepods (microscopic host crustaceans,
    which are much larger than bacteria) to break the cycle of disease, and
    simple cloth filtration can greatly reduce the transmission of cholera.
    Simple filtration can also be used to reduce turbidity and improve the
    efficiency of other treatment processes (e.g., SODIS, chlorination).

    Chemical treatment methods
</h6>
<p>
    In-home treatment to remove chemical contamination of water is less
    widespread than for microbiological contamination, but becoming more common
    in areas with severe contamination problems. As is the case for
    microbiological treatment, the main constraint is not technical – a variety
    of technologies exist for removing chemical contaminants. The problem is
    that few are sufficiently affordable, simple and robust enough to be
    sustainably applied in household in rural and peri-urban settings. The two
    most important examples are arsenic and fluoride removal (home treatment
    systems are also available for other contaminants, such as iron and
    manganese – see 5.2 for more information).
</p>
<h5>
    Nirmal: combined household treatment of arsenic and iron in West Bengal
</h5>
<p>
    In West Bengal (and elsewhere) arsenic-contaminated groundwater often has a
    high dissolved iron content. UNICEF and the Government of West Bengal have
    developed a low-cost household unit to remove both iron and arsenic. The
    unit is manufactured in local sanitary marts and marketed under the name
    “Nirmal”, meaning “clean” in Bengali. It costs about $US10 to purchase and
    US$1 per year to operate.
</p>
<p>
    The iron removal portion of the filter is based on a successful low-cost
    domestic iron filter from the Indian state of Tripura. A filter candle is
    produced by local potters, using a process that combines fired clay and
    rice husks to produce a porous, easily cleaned, carbon-based “clay husk”
    filter. Following iron removal, arsenic is removed in an activated alumina
    sachet. The filter body is constructed of ferro-cement using materials and
    techniques familiar to local masons.
</p>
<p>
    This choice of a technology that removes both iron and arsenic is highly
    appropriate. A combined filter is more marketable in the affected areas
    than an arsenic-only filter because iron, unlike arsenic, is a problem that
    people can see and taste. In addition, removing iron before removing
    arsenic makes the arsenic portion of the unit much more efficient, and
    results in longer use of the activated alumina adsorption media.
</p>
<p>
    Eventually, the media must be changed: the local sanitary mart provides
    replacement sachets and regenerates the spent activated alumina using
    strong alkalis and acids. The filter designers have devised a unique system
    for disposing of the arsenic-rich regenerate solution. It is being used by
    sanitary marts in the production of latrine squatting plates, effectively
    preventing any possible re-contamination of the environment.
</p>
<h5>
    Fluoride removal in India
</h5>
<p>
    The Nalgonda process has been adapted for domestic defluoridation in India.
    Water is treated in a 50-litre bucket fitted with a tap near the bottom.
    First, alum and bleaching powder are mixed rapidly with raw water in the
    bucket. Lime solution is then added and stirred rapidly for a few minutes,
    followed by slow stirring for 10 minutes. The correct alum and lime dose
    must be determined before treatment and depend primarily on the fluoride
    and alkalinity level of the raw water. After stirring, the suspension is
    allowed to settle for at least two hours, and the supernatant is drawn out
    through the tap into an appropriate storage container. Filtration is
    recommended, either through a ceramic candle filter or sand bed, to ensure
    that residual aluminium flocs are removed.
</p>
<p>
    This system is consistently able to produce water with &lt; 1 mg/L
    fluoride, with raw waters containing up to 20 mg/L fluoride. The use of
    bleaching powder protects against contamination with pathogens, and the
    system is inexpensive and easy to implement with locally available
    materials. Disadvantages include the need for careful stirring and the
    regular production of sludge waste, which is discarded in a brick-lined
    pit.

    5.3.4 Water treatment in emergencies
</h4>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The safety of water supplies is often compromised during emergency
    situations. In some cases, water sources and supplies are contaminated.
    During floods, for example, contaminated surface water pollutes wells and
    reservoirs. In other cases, water supplies are interrupted and people are
    forced to use alternative, unsafe sources. Either water supplies are
    physically damaged (such as during an earthquake) or the emergency
    situation forces people to flee their homes, away from established water
    sources and systems. In both cases, contaminated water and the lack of
    water can – and often do – lead to the outbreak of water- and
    hygiene-related diseases such as cholera.
</p>
<p>
    While microbiological contamination is by far the most common risk to water
    supplies in emergencies (and the subject of this section), the threat of
    chemical contamination also exists. For example, an oil spill can threaten
    water supplies. In recognition of this, the 2006 update of the WHO GDWQ
    includes a new section on chemical water quality in emergencies (WHO, 2006
    Section 8.6), which serves as a good resource for this type of emergency
    (and is included in the additional resources at the end of this section).

    , UNICEF is committed to supporting certain programmatic interventions
    during emergencies, including water supply and, specifically, the treatment
    of contaminated water. This discussion focuses on water quality, which is
    only part of an overall package of WES interventions in emergencies. See
    the key references at the end of this chapter for further resources on WES
    in emergencies.
</p>
<p>
    There are three stages of water quality treatment interventions for
    emergencies: planning and preparedness, emergency water treatment
    immediately after the emergency event and the re-establishment of treatment
    systems after the event.

    Techniques for emergency treatment of household/personal water supplies
</h6>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    All techniques for home water treatment discussed in 5.3.3 can be applied
    in emergencies, depending on the situation and the stage of the emergency
    intervention. When possible, it is always better to accelerate or expand
    ongoing programmes than introduce a totally new treatment technique. In
    areas with an ongoing SODIS programme, for example, the most effective
    intervention may be a special intensive campaign using existing promotional
    material.
</p>
<p>
    When people are displaced due to emergencies, water containers for
    transporting and storing water are as much a necessity as treatment. In
    response UNICEF has developed the Basic Family Water Kit which includes
    buckets, collapsible storage containers, soap, chlorine tablets and/or
    coagulation/chlorination sachets. Oxfam distributes a similar kit, while
    WHO has developed a Hygiene in Emergencies kit.
</p>
<p>
    The five most common household/personal treatment techniques used in
    emergencies are described below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Chlorine tablets:</strong>
    Chlorination using manufactured tablets is the most common emergency water
    treatment technique for small volumes of water. A variety of brands,
    compositions and sizes of tablets are available for use by aid agencies in
    emergencies. The most common formulation is sodium dichloroisocyanurate
    (NaDCC) as the chlorine donor in an effervescent formulation for rapid
    dissolving. Several factors should be considered by planners before
    purchasing and distributing tablets:
</p>
<p>
    o the tablets procured should be sized so that only one is needed to purify
    water in standard locally available containers (such as a 20 l jerry can)
</p>
<p>
    o tablets should not be distributed without instructions, including both
    written instructions in the local language and additional communication
    material (such as pictographs or radio messages) to reach illiterate people
    and reinforce the written instructions
</p>
<p>
    o if possible, tablets should be visibly distinct (larger, a distinct
    colour) from common pills in that country to avoid situations where people
    take chlorine tablets orally, thinking they are medicine.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bleach/chlorine powder:</strong>
    Powdered forms of chlorine are also commonly used, both for treating
    containers of water and for disinfecting family wells and cisterns. The
    advantage of powdered chlorine is that it is available almost everywhere.
    The main disadvantage is that it must be measured correctly and mistakes
    are therefore more likely than with tablets. Different brands of bleaching
    powder can have different chlorine concentrations, making it difficult to
    design standard instructional messages. In addition, some bleaching powder
    contains soap or other additives making it inappropriate for water
    treatment. Relatively clear water is necessary for the effective use of
    either chlorine powder or tablets, and in some cases it is necessary to
    filter water (through cloth, for example) to reduce turbidity before using
    chlorine.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Combined coagulation, precipitation and chlorination:</strong>
    As discussed in 5.3.3, this method has the important advantage of being
    effective in purifying poor quality, turbid water, which is common in
    emergency situations. Some products use a time-release form of chlorine to
    increase residual disinfection. The same criteria for effectively using
    chlorine tablets apply to these products (i.e., sizing as per local
    containers, provision of instructional material). And because this method
    always requires the extra step of removing the precipitate from the treated
    water (filtration through a cloth, or by decantation) additional
    instructions are required.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Microfiltration: </strong>
    Membrane microfiltration products are widely used in recreation (camping,
    hiking) and increasingly in emergency situations. The technology has two
    main advantages: it requires no consumables and can remove some pesticides
    and heavy metals in addition to microbiological pathogens. Due to its
    relatively high cost (compared to chlorine tablets), microfiltration is
    still used mainly by emergency workers themselves and not commonly
    distributed on a large scale. Costs are falling however, and some companies
    are beginning to manufacture products designed for distribution in
    emergency situations in developing countries.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Boiling:</strong>
    While boiling is often not viable option due to the lack of fuel and/or
    receptacles, there are emergency situations in which boiling is
    appropriate. One common example is in urban areas where piped water
    supplies have been compromised and no alternative treatment alternative
    exists. In such situations, a boil water advisory is issued by the relevant
    authorities over appropriate media channels. The new section 7.6 in the WHO
    DWQG “Identifying local actions in response to microbial water quality
    problems and emergencies” discussed criteria, protocols and methodologies
    concerning boil water advisories in detail (see additional references at
    the end of this section).

<h5>
    First steps for managing cholera and shigella outbreaks
</h5>
<p>
    In emergency situations, large numbers of people may be crowded together in
    areas that previously had little water and sanitation infrastructure. This
    leads to a serious risk of an epidemic of diarrhoeal disease. Cholera and
    shigella are particularly dangerous: these two diseases swept through
    refugee camps in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1994, causing at
    least 48,000 cases and 23,800 deaths.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The WHO leaflet, “First steps for managing an outbreak of acute diarrhoea”
    provides specific information on cholera<em> </em>and shigella, including
    detailed symptoms, strategies for protecting communities from further
    infection and treatment options for patients. It and other resources on
    cholera are available online at: <u>www.who.int/csr/disease/cholera/en</u>
</p>
<p>
    A special technique for responding to cholera emergencies is the use of
    lime juice as a disinfectant. Adding lime juice to water lowers pH levels
    and can effectively inactivate <em>Vibrio cholerae. </em>If pH levels are
    lowered below 4.5 for at least 3 hours, virtually all the cholera bacteria
    will be eliminated. To achieve this pH reduction, lime juice should be
    added to water at a concentration of at least 1 percent. A study in Guinea
    Bissau showed that adding lime juice to foods such as porridge can also
    effectively control cholera transmissions (Rodrigues et al., 2000).
</p>
<p>
    As discussed in 5.1, cloth filtration can also be used to help reduce the
    transmission of cholera.
</p>
<h6>
    Techniques for the treatment of water in camps
</h6>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    It is better to use a safe and protected source of water for refugee and
    displaced people camp systems than to install and operate a water treatment
    system. If there is a choice, camps should be located near a safe source –
    such as a deep tubewell – or a new protected source should be constructed.
    However, in many cases this is not possible:
</p>
<p>
    camps need to be set up quickly and unprotected surface sources are often
    the only viable option. In such cases, treatment to improve the
    microbiological quality of water is always necessary.
</p>
<p>
    The design of water treatment systems for camps varies, based on many
    factors, including water source quality, camp size, locally available
    resources (human and material) and expected lifespan of the camp. But all
    systems have two things in common: they should be fast and easy to set up
    and should have low maintenance and operation requirements. Camps must
    sometimes be set up in two or three days, and are often located in remote
    locations – treatment systems must be designed accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    Treatment systems in camps usually involve the reduction of suspended
    solids through sedimentation, coagulation/flocculation or some multi-stage
    filtration process. In most cases, pre-treated water is then chlorinated.
    In some instances, treatment for chemical contamination is required, but
    this is a relatively rare occurrence in camps.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sedimentation:</strong>
    In emergency situations, sedimentation alone for the removal of suspended
    solids is usually only used as a temporary measure until a more permanent
    system can be set up. While sedimentation can effectively remove most
    suspended solids, it requires either large holding tanks to allow water to
    sit over relatively long periods of time and/or specially designed
    horizontal flow sedimentation tanks – both of which are typically not an
    option in camp settings. Sedimentation is more commonly used as part of a
    larger system: either as a pre-treatment measure to remove coarse solids or
    to remove flocs after coagulation/flocculation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Coagulation/flocculation: </strong>
    This method is the most commonly used for the removal of suspended solids
    in emergency situations because it can be set up very quickly, and because
    of the wide availability of aluminium sulphate (alum) in developing
    countries. In many emergency situations, a batch method is used because it
    is easier to manage than a continuous flow method.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Filtration: </strong>
    Filtration is used as pre-treatment of water supplies to remove larger
    particulate matter (roughing filters) and to remove flocs after
    coagulation/flocculation. Slow sand filtration systems are sometimes used
    instead of coagulation and flocculation in emergency situations, especially
    in long-term camps and in areas where a regular supply of alum is
    unavailable.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Chlorination: </strong>
    Chlorination is recommended in most camp situations. Even when the source
    is safe, the large population density in camps significantly increases the
    risk of recontamination and the residual protection that chlorine provides
    is a necessity. As is the case for coagulation/flocculation, chlorination
    is often carried out on a batch basis. In camps that rely on hand-dug
    wells, pot chlorination units can be used to improve water safety.
</p>
<p>
    All water treatment systems require skilled technicians for operation and
    maintenance and special health and safety equipment for chemical handling,
    especially for chlorine. In most countries, there are technicians available
    who are familiar with the treatment processes used in camps.
</p>
<p>
    In most cases, water treatment systems in camps are set up using
    pre-manufactured kits that are assembled on site. In developing countries,
    the kits developed by Oxfam and by ICRC are the most commonly used. The
    kits are manufactured by several different companies and other agencies –
    including UNICEF – use these or similar kits on a regular basis. Turn-key
    water purification units that require no assembly are also used extensively
    in emergency situations. These units are usually trailer mounted and
    require a power source. See the key references for more detailed supply
    procurement information and listings.

<h1>
    Raising Awareness and Building Capacity
</h1>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Water quality is often a much lower national priority than water coverage.
    This is especially the case in countries where coverage levels are low, but
    it is sometimes common in high-coverage countries as well. The focus on
    coverage has been echoed and reinforced to a large extent by the
    international community. Programmes of support continue to emphasize
    coverage over quality, and global coverage figures do not yet take into
    account the water quality aspect (although this is changing – the
    UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation is
    currently developing methodologies for the inclusion of water quality data
    in coverage figures: see JMP, 2008).
</p>
<p>
    This situation is a largely a reflection of the public’s low level of
    awareness of water quality issues. People usually do not demand improved
    quality, they demand increased coverage and improved service levels – and
    governments respond accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    Low priority results in poor capacity. In many countries, water monitoring
    and surveillance systems are weak and sectoral professionals with water
    quality expertise are relatively rare. Consequently, even widespread water
    quality problems go unnoticed until the public health system begins to
    register large numbers of water-related disease cases and deaths.
    Programming for water quality tends to be reactive – responding to serious
    problems as they occur rather than focusing on safety and prevention.
</p>
<p>
    The situation is beginning to change. Awareness in communities is
    increasing in some countries as sources become polluted due to population
    pressure, intensive agriculture and industrialization. In other countries,
    especially where coverage is high, additional resources are now being
    allocated to water quality. In an increasing number of countries, UNICEF
    programming in the area of water is shifting away from water supply and
    towards water quality. In addition, the arsenic situation in Asia and
    elsewhere has highlighted the importance of water quality and resulted in
    higher awareness among decision-makers in governments and the international
    sectoral community. However, because awareness levels continue to be low in
    most countries, action is necessary to avoid the emergence of more serious
    water quality problems. UNICEF can play an important role in highlighting
    the importance of water quality at the national and community levels,
    contribute to the creation of an enabling policy environment for water
    quality programming and help to build capacity to strengthen national
    surveillance and protection systems.
</p>
<h2>
    6.1 Advocating for water quality
</h2>
<p>
    At the country level, UNICEF is often the most respected external support
    agency in the water and sanitation sector, due to its long-term programmes
    of support and continuous presence. UNICEF country offices have an
    extensive range of contacts at all levels of governments and with civil
    society organizations and other sectoral stakeholders. Given the increasing
    importance of water quality, this unique position should be used for
    raising awareness and promoting action on water quality issues.
</p>
<p>
    Advocacy with governments and other partners is an increasingly important
    part of
</p>
<p>
    UNICEF programmes, in WES and in other sectors. Even though UNICEF often
    has a prominent role in the water and sanitation sector, its financial
    resources are typically only a small fraction of those of governments and
    of development banks and some bilateral agencies. Leveraging the resources
    of other stakeholders and influencing sectoral allocations is becoming a
    key role for UNICEF country offices.

<p>
    A common concern in UNICEF country offices is that WES professionals work
    full time (or more!) on implementation, planning, fundraising and other
    activities and do not have time to focus on advocacy. Prioritizing advocacy
    within WES sections and country offices, and including advocacy as a
    specific activity in workplans is the first step towards improving water
    quality advocacy efforts.
</p>
<p>
    The most effective advocacy is evidence-based, and thus advocacy begins
    with information gathering (see Table 6.2). In the area of water quality,
    surveys are often the first step. A rapid assessment ( 3.1.1) or new data
    from improved national monitoring systems (S 3.1.2) can form the evidence
    basis for a water quality advocacy programme. The UNICEF situation analysis
    exercise is an opportunity for launching a special water quality survey in
    partnership with government. The act of gathering data can itself be a form
    of advocacy if carried out in coordination with government and other
    partners, or as part of multi-agency assessment and coordination
    frameworks, such as the United Nations Common Country Assessment process,
    the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and Sector-Wide Approaches processes.

<p>
    Advocacy for new approaches to water quality programming is more effective
    when results from field work can be demonstrated. Pilot projects are thus
    an important part of advocacy. Implementation of the pilot project is only
    the first step. Assessment, documentation and presentation of results are
    also important steps – there is no point in implementing a pilot project if
    results are not disseminated and used to inform policies and practices.
</p>
<p>
    A key component of evidence-based advocacy in the area of water quality is
    information from other countries. Because of the large number and wide
    geographic spread of UNICEF WES programmes worldwide, UNICEF country
    offices are in a unique position to disseminate lessons learned from other
    countries. The spread of the H<sub>2</sub>S system for bacteriological
    water quality monitoring (see 3.2.1) from India to other countries is one
    example of this sort of information dissemination. Another example is
    transfer of knowledge in the area of arsenic mitigation (see box).
</p>
<h5>
    Evidence, advocacy, action: arsenic in Vietnam
</h5>
<p>
    As the extent of the arsenic contamination problem in Bangladesh and India
    became clearer in the 1990s, UNICEF and its partners began to investigate
    the possibility of the presence of arsenic in other regions with similar
    hydrology and geochemistry. In Vietnam, UNICEF sponsored arsenic testing in
    Hanoi and other areas in the Red River delta region that confirmed the
    arsenic in groundwater at levels higher than the national standard. Based
    on this evidence, and using lessons learned from other countries, UNICEF
    launched an information sharing and advocacy programme with key government
    ministries and agencies. The programme used a variety of methods, including
    publishing an information brochure, raising the subject during regular
    sectoral coordination meetings and sponsoring visits of government
    officials to other arsenicaffected countries.
</p>
<p>
    UNICEF also supported two national arsenic conferences in Vietnam, which
    led to the development and ratification of a national action plan and the
    formation of a national arsenic coordination committee. Arsenic-related
    activities are now incorporated into sectoral ministry plans of action, and
    a coordinated and comprehensive mitigation programme is in place to address
    the problem (with continued support from UNICEF and partners).
</p>
<p>
    Effective advocacy requires planning. Planning includes the definition of
    specific advocacy goals (e.g., policy change, increased budgets, staffing),
    the identification of targets (e.g., high level government officials,
    sectoral managers, professional associations), the types of information to
    be presented and the means of dissemination (e.g., print materials for
    different audiences, effective use of the media, sponsoring national
    seminars, developing presentations for use at high-level meetings).
</p>
<p>
    UNICEF can also play a role in helping to ensure that data from water
    quality monitoring and surveillance systems are used as the basis for
    improvements in water supply system management and programming. UNICEF can
    help, through advocacy and support to planning processes, that resources
    are available to support follow-up efforts. If new policies need to be
    formulated, for example, UNICEF can support the development process. If
    advocacy leads to new methodologies or implementation systems, UNICEF or
    its partners can contribute to necessary institutional capacity building.
</p>
<h2>
    6.2 Institutional capacity building
</h2>
<p>
    Effective and sustainable water safety is best achieved through a
    preventive management approach that monitors and protects water resources
    throughout the entire water chain, from catchment and source to end user.
    This requires the involvement and collaboration of multiple agencies, each
    working within its own geographic or thematic jurisdiction. A municipal
    water company, for example, cannot control upstream water pollution without
    the involvement of other agencies; nor can a ministry of health on its own
    define and control manufacturing standards of products such as handpumps.
</p>
<p>
    Capacity building for water quality starts with the identification of
    institutional stakeholders, and an assessment of their current ability to
    meet roles and responsibilities. This process can be part of the
    development of a water safety plan (see box in 4.4). Inputs and support to
    institutions may involve training and professional development, but should
    focus on the development of sustainable systems within institutions and
    practical collaboration mechanisms between institutions.

<p>
    In some cases, institutional capacity building will only be successful if
    linked to sector reform. In some countries, for example, the bulk of water
    supply activities are carried out by the private sector but state water
    supply agencies have yet to make the transition from being service
    providers themselves to a role of monitoring and supervision. In other
    countries, decentralization of water supply activities is underway but
    central government agencies do not yet have the institutional structure to
    facilitate the trend. In such cases, directing capacity building efforts
    towards the strengthening of new institutional systems in support of
    sectoral reform will have a significant impact.
</p>
<p>
    Capacity building is an ongoing process and is sustainable only when
    national and local institutions are available for providing training and
    institutional development services for water agencies. The resources of
    external support agencies like UNICEF can be more effective when working
    with and strengthening these institutions (e.g., universities and colleges,
    research institutes, professional societies, private training centres).
</p>
<p>
    Sectoral training programmes do not always include water quality, and even
    when they do it is often only a minor component. An important part of
    designing or influencing national water safety programmes is ensuring that
    water quality is fully embedded in standard sectoral curricula and that
    separate water quality-specific courses are available for students and
    sector professionals. Training course subject areas include risk assessment
    and management, water quality guidelines and standards, health-based
    planning for water safety, sanitation and hygiene promotion, monitoring and
    surveillance, groundwater and surface water quality, research skills and
    techniques, water treatment (including appropriate low-cost remediation
    technologies), treatment of effluents and water policy development.
</p>
<p>
    Training resources for water quality are available from the academic
    community and through a variety of sectoral agencies and resources,
    including the United Nations (see box).

    6.3 Raising awareness and creating demand in communities
</h2>
<p>
    People have a right to know about the quality status of their water
    supplies: whether or not their drinking water is contaminated and what
    effect that has on their health and the health of their families. People
    also have a right to know about what solutions are available to improve
    water quality. As a rights-based organization, UNICEF has a responsibility
    to ensure that the right to knowledge is respected in the area of water
    quality.
</p>
<h5>
    Safe water is a basic human right
</h5>
<p>
    Two core human rights treaties have explicitly recognized the right to
    water: the
</p>
<p>
    Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination
    of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The latter also recognizes
    the importance of sanitation. In both cases, the right to water was
    affirmed as a prerequisite for the realization of child and human rights to
    health and adequate living conditions. In 2002, the United Nations formally
    declared access to domestic water supply service a human right in and of
    itself, through the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
            Against Women, 1979, Article 14
        </em>
    </strong>
    states that women have the right to “adequate living conditions,
    particularly in relation to housing, sanitation, electricity and water
    supply, transport and communication.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, Article 24</em>
    </strong>
    notes that states should take steps to ensure the realization of a child’s
    right to health, including “to combat disease and malnutrition ... through
    the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water, taking
    into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
            Rights, General Comment 15, 2002
        </em>
    </strong>
    affirms that “the human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient,
    safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal
    and domestic uses” and that “the human right to water is indispensable for
    leading a life in human dignity” and that it is “a prerequisite for the
    realization of other human rights.”
</p>
<p>
    A right to know goes beyond gaining awareness about the problem and
    possible solutions to the problem. People should also be informed of the
    responsibilities of duty-bearers in governments, water service providers
    and the community to ensure domestic water safety. When families and
    communities are aware of the problem, the solution and the responsibilities
    they and others have to keep water safe, they can more effectively take
    action. Knowledgeable communities are also more likely to demand improved
    service from providers such as water companies or contractors and to
    challenge politicians and government officials when there are water quality
    problems in the community. This can sometimes lead to resistance to
    awareness-raising programmes of this nature.
</p>
<p>
    Awareness-raising for water quality begins with hygiene and sanitation
    promotion. In developing countries the most serious water quality problem
    is faecal contamination, and the most effective way of protecting water
    sources and interrupting the faecal-oral cycle is through hygiene and
    sanitation. The challenge is not only to inform people about the links
    between sanitation and health, faecal contamination pathways and remedial
    measures, but to promote behavioural change and safe hygiene practices. See
    4.2 and the UNICEF sanitation and hygiene promotion manuals for more
    information on hygiene and sanitation promotion.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to hygiene and sanitation promotion, awareness-raising
    programmes are used as a starting point for community-based water quality
    surveillance programmes (see 3.1.3), to promote service upgrades to improve
    water safety and, in areas with specific water quality problems such as
    fluoride or iron, to sensitize communities about the problem and present
    solutions.
</p>
<p>

        src="file:///C:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image019.gif"
        align="left"
    />
    In all cases, awareness-raising and demand-creation campaigns should be
    carefully designed and planned. They should be based on the best available
    information and new research on the issue and on the target communities
    themselves. UNICEF communication programmes use the ACADA communication
    planning model, an extension of the Triple-A approach (assessment,
    analysis, action).
</p>
<p>
    The ACADA process begins with a situation assessment using existing and new
    information sources, including knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP)
    studies, special surveys,
</p>
<p>
    monitoring and evaluation reports. The situation assessment must ensure
    that marginalized groups within the community – including women, children
    and the poor – are taken into account through the collection of
    disaggregated data. In the case of water quality, the assessment includes
    best available knowledge of the extent of the water quality problem and its
    effect on communities. When the assessment is completed a detailed
    communication analysis is formulated – which clearly defines the problem,
    analyzes actual practices and desirable behavioural changes, and develops
    clear communication objectives and strategies. The communication analysis
    is the basis for the design of the communication campaign itself: the
    development of messages and choices of media and methodologies. The
    campaign material is developed, field tested, modified as necessary and
    launched. See the UNICEF
    <em>
        Manual on Communication for Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation
        Programmes
    </em>
    for detailed instruction on the ACADA process and communication
    programming.
</p>
<p>
    For water quality communication, messages will include advice and
    instruction on what steps the community should take to mitigate water
    quality problems. In the case of emerging or poorly understood problems,
    technical advice from specialists and agreement among national stakeholders
    will be necessary before messages can be formulated. In the development of
    the UNICEF-supported Bangladesh arsenic communication campaign, for
    example, a special consultation process was used to
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="404"
        height="4"
        src="file:///C:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image020.gif"
        align="left"
    />
    develop a set of agreed technical parameters before messages on arsenic
    mitigation were finalized.
</p>
<p>
    A primary goal of water quality communication programmes is demand creation
    – not only for improved services from government and other service
    providers as discussed above, but for new services and products purchased
    by community members themselves. This may be a new or improved
    community-financed water system, a safer water source, a more accessible
    water testing facility or service, improved storage and handling containers
    or home water treatment systems. Successful communication programmes
    promoting such products or services must ensure that they are available and
    affordable, and that there is a range of appropriate options from which to
    choose based on income, willingness to pay and personal
</p>
<p>
    preference.
</p>
<p>
    Reaching out to women in particular should be a central part of community
    awareness- raising programmes. In many communities, household water is
    managed exclusively by women. Women and girls are generally the ones who
    obtain water for the home, transport it, store it and then use it for
    various household purposes. Women are also the primary guardians of
    household hygiene. It is therefore essential to direct communication
    messages at women. But effective-awareness raising programmes go beyond
    simply targeting women with messages, they also enlist women as allies and
    support women as advocates for water safety within their households and
    communities.

<h2>
    6.4 Community capacity building
</h2>
<p>
    Awareness-raising in communities is the first step in a process of change.
    Informed and motivated individuals will begin to make the changes necessary
    to improve the water quality status of their homes and community, but
    additional knowledge and tools are necessary to improve the community’s
    capacity to act as their own water quality custodians. While improved
    government surveillance systems and better practices among water service
    providers are significant steps, empowered communities are the key to
    significant and sustainable change.
</p>
<p>
    Training is only part of community capacity building – the strengthening of
    local management bodies and processes is also an important step. Programmes
    and agencies working with communities on water quality must first determine
    the role of existing governance structures, including both formal and
    traditional bodies. In addition, existing sectoral management systems, such
    as water supply maintenance committees or community health committees,
    should be inventoried and assessed. In most cases, an existing structure
    can be used for water quality management and the creation of a new system
    can be avoided. (In some countries, each new development programme sets up
    management structures at the community level – which can become a burden on
    community members who are busy with their own lives.)
</p>
<p>
    Water quality projects – and WES programmes in general – should promote
    equality of participation in any new or existing management structure.
    Marginalized members of the community should be given a voice on these
    bodies, and women – as household water managers – should have a central
    role. When these structures are inequitable, the project should encourage
    change.
</p>
<p>
    Once the management structure has been determined, the extent of local
    authority over water resources and ownership of water systems should be
    clarified. Only in some countries do communities have clear title to
    government-provided water systems; in others, water systems remain the
    property of central government or their ownership is unclear. The
    productive use of local water resources by individuals (such as farmers)
    and the effects of this use on domestic water sources is an important
    consideration. Although it may be governed by national legislation, it must
    often be dealt with at the local level as well. Only when these issues are
    clarified can communities effectively take responsibility for the safety of
    their own water supplies.
</p>
<p>
    All communities have capacity, knowledge and skills. External support
    programmes should neither impose new systems or methodologies on
    communities, nor should they make unilateral decisions about what type of
    capacity building is required. In all cases, participatory approaches
    should be used to determine the structure and content of capacity building
    for water quality. Communities, knowing their own capacity, will be best
    able to choose – with the assistance of support agencies – what new skills
    are required to supplement existing resources. Training programmes can be
    designed accordingly. The use of participatory approaches will ensure that
    the community has ownership of the process and will be motivated to
    participate in training programmes and apply new skills. On the other hand,
    participatory approaches often take longer than topdown pre-designed
    programmes and UNICEF and other agencies must be flexible enough to allow
    for this.
</p>
<p>
    Community capacity building for water quality may be an independent
    initiative, or it may be part of a larger water and sanitation development
    programme. In any case, training for water quality covers a wide range of
    subject areas (see Table 6.4), applicable on a case by case basis depending
    on need, the preference of communities and the structure of the national
    water supply programme.

<p>
    Community capacity building is an ongoing process. Programmes of support in
    the area of water quality must be designed to ensure that in-country
    resources for supporting communities are available on a continuous basis.
    UNICEF programmes should therefore not only direct resources towards
    communities themselves, but should strengthen appropriate institutions such
    as NGOs and rural training institutes as service providers for capacity
    building.

            This method is sometimes called the ‘most probable number’ method,
            but that term is more properly applied to any method which involves
            incubation of multiple samples to give a statistical estimate of
            bacterial density

            Colorimeters and spectrophotometers do the same thing: measure the
            amount of light of a certain wavelength that passes through a
            sample. The main difference is that colorimeters direct a broad
            band of the light spectrum onto the sample, while
            spectrophotometers use a tight band around the wavelength of
            interest. Spectrophotometers can achieve lower detection limits,
            but are more expensive.
